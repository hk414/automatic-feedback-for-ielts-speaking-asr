3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at a generally natural pace with a clear attempt to develop a coherent response. They use basic cohesive devices like "because" and "and" to link ideas, and their topic development is relevant and sustained throughout the two-minute timeframe. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections, such as the repeated "or" in "I also think so, yeah, I want to go someday or I want to know about more," which disrupts fluency and suggests some effort in retrieving vocabulary. This aligns with Band 6.5, where fluency is generally smooth but with occasional lapses.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a sufficient range of vocabulary for the topic, using words like "amazing," "fascinating," "ancient treasures," and "landscapes" to describe Egypt. They also attempt to paraphrase by saying "I want to know about more" instead of "learn more," showing some awareness of lexical variety. The vocabulary is appropriate and relevant, with a mix of general and topic-specific terms, which supports a Band 7 score. However, there is some repetition of "I want to know" and "I want to go," which slightly limits the lexical range.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and compound sentences, such as "I've seen many movies and documentaries about Egypt and I think their culture is really amazing." However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including the incorrect use of "or" in "I also think so, yeah, I want to go someday or I want to know about more," which shows confusion between coordinating conjunctions. Additionally, the phrase "I always want to know about more Egypt" is grammatically incorrect; it should be "I always want to know more about Egypt." These errors, while not severely impacting meaning, affect grammatical accuracy and limit the score to Band 6.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout the response. They use appropriate stress and intonation, such as in "ancient treasures" and "I want to go someday," which enhances the natural flow of speech. There are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension, and the rhythm is generally consistent. This level of clarity and intelligibility supports a Band 7 score.
