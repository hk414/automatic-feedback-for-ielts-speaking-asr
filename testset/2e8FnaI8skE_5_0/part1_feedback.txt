3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at a natural pace with only minor hesitations, such as "um" and "uh," which do not disrupt the flow of ideas. They maintain coherence by using simple linking words like "so" and "but" to connect thoughts, as seen when explaining their schedule and social habits. However, there are moments of repetition, such as saying "new people" twice in quick succession, which slightly reduces the overall fluency and prevents a higher score.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using phrases like "kind of extrovert person," "connect new experiences," and "find some new chance." They also employ less common words such as "strict" and "schedule" appropriately. Their lexical choices are generally precise and show an ability to paraphrase, for example, using "meet new people" instead of repeating "see new people," which contributes to a strong lexical resource score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "I also find some new chance that I can new people," which shows an attempt at varied structures. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including "I can new people" (should be "I can meet new people") and "I really welcome them so if they welcome to me" (should be "if they welcome me"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, indicate limited control over certain grammatical forms, particularly verb patterns and prepositions.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. They articulate words like "experience" and "schedule" accurately, and their stress patterns are generally appropriate. There are no significant pronunciation issues that hinder comprehension, and their delivery is confident and natural, aligning with Band 7 features.
