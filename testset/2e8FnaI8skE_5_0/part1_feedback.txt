1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency, uses a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures appropriately, and maintains coherence throughout the responses, though with some hesitation and minor grammatical inaccuracies.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using discourse markers like "so" and "but" to connect ideas. For example, they say, "I really like to hang out with my friends and also meet new people so I can connect new... new experience or new people," which shows an attempt to extend the response coherently. However, there are noticeable hesitations ("um," "uh") and self-corrections ("I mean new people"), which slightly disrupt the natural rhythm. These features align with Band 7, where fluency is generally fluent but not effortless, with some repetition and hesitation.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using phrases like "connect new experience," "meet new people," and "find some new chance," which shows flexibility and an attempt to paraphrase. They also use appropriate collocations such as "really welcome them" and "strict schedule." The vocabulary is generally precise and relevant to the topic, which is characteristic of Band 7.5, where the candidate uses less common items with some style awareness, though there is occasional awkwardness in word choice.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "I also find some new chance that I can meet new people," which shows an attempt at complex sentence construction. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as "I mean new people" (repetition) and "I really welcome them so if they welcome to me" (incorrect use of "welcome to me"). These errors, while not severely impacting understanding, prevent a higher score. This aligns with Band 6.5, where the candidate uses a mix of structures but with frequent errors that affect clarity.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with appropriate stress and intonation in most parts of the response. For example, in "I really like to hang out with my friends," the stress is correctly placed on "really" and "friends." However, there are some minor mispronunciations, such as "chance" being pronounced as "chance" with a slight vowel shift, and occasional unclear word boundaries. These features are typical of Band 7, where pronunciation is generally effective and does not impede understanding, though there are some lapses in rhythm and intonation.
