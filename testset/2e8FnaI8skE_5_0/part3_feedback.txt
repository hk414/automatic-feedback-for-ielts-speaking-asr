3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, managing to stay on topic throughout the responses. They use some cohesive devices like "so" and "and then" to link ideas, which helps maintain coherence. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections, such as "I can, I, I think," which indicate a slight lack of spontaneity and fluency. These pauses prevent the response from reaching a Band 8 level, where fluency is more effortless.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using terms like "immerse their culture," "overwhelmed," and "social life" appropriately. They also show flexibility by paraphrasing ideas, such as explaining how social media helps improve language skills. The vocabulary is relevant and varied enough to support the discussion on culture and language learning, aligning with Band 7.5 expectations.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "I think if you use social media well, that it can improve your language skills really high." However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement ("that it can improve") and awkward phrasing ("really high"). While the candidate uses some complex structures, the frequency of errors limits the score to Band 6.5.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and mostly accurate, with good intonation and rhythm that contribute to easy understanding. There are no significant pronunciation issues that hinder communication. The candidate's delivery is confident and natural, which supports a Band 7 score.
