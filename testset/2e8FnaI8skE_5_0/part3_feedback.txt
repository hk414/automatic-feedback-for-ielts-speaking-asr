3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate generally speaks at length without significant pauses, demonstrating a good ability to maintain the topic. For example, they provide a detailed response to the question about learning foreign cultures, using phrases like "I think if you use social media well" to structure their answer. However, there are noticeable hesitations, such as "um" and "uh" fillers, and a slight repetition when saying "I can I I think," which indicates some effort in organizing thoughts. These features align with Band 7, where fluency is flexible but not effortless.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a range of vocabulary relevant to the topic, including "social media," "immerse their culture," and "improve your language skills." They also demonstrate some flexibility by using phrases like "really high" to emphasize a point. The vocabulary is generally precise and appropriate, showing awareness of idiomatic expressions, which supports a Band 7.5 score. However, there is occasional repetition of words like "language" and "culture," which slightly limits the lexical range.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "I think if you use social media well, then it can improve your language skills really high." However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as "it can improve yours language skills really high," which shows a lack of accuracy in article usage and word order. Additionally, the sentence "that I can translate every language in my head first and then I have to say" contains grammatical issues that affect clarity. These errors prevent a higher score, placing the candidate in Band 6.5.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. For example, their delivery of "I think if you use social media well" is natural and fluent. However, there are some minor pronunciation issues, such as the mispronunciation of "language" as "linguage" and "social media" as "sociar media," which slightly affect intelligibility. These features are consistent with Band 7, where pronunciation is effective but not fully native-like.
