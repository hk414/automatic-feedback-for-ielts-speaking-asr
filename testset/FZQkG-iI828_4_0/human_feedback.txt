 Okay, so feedback time. Yep, thank you. Let's start with a good confidence. You don't seem afraid to talk, you don't seem shy to talk. So that would be something that we grade positively. We always look at your fluency and your willingness to talk. So I think you will score well in terms of your willingness to talk. However, there are a few things that we have to work on, maybe. First of all, it would be grammar and sentence structure. So I think from a grammar standpoint, using phrases like you heard to news, reading to is interest using those phrases, that's not the correct grammar to use. So I think those are definitely things to work on in the future. Your vocabulary, I think that can be improved as well. I don't think that you were always able to express your feeling correctly because of maybe a limited vocabulary at this point. So I think that is an area to improve on as well. Sentin structure as well. For example, I wrote down the example, some people, this problem, like that structure is something that we need to work on as well, going forward. Unfortunately, you understood two of the questions and how do friends get news that one was initially misunderstood. But I think very vitally in this question, you understood part two, you completely misunderstood that question. So because of that, that's going to impact your grade quite a lot in this case. So the question in part two was describe an occasion when somebody gave you positive advice or suggestions about your work or study. So that would be a case where let's say you were working on a project or you were studying for an exam or taking a course and somebody gave you advice on how to improve, how to be better. I think your answer wasn't completely ticking the boxes of what we wanted to know. For example, who the person is, what they said, how the advice affected you. I think you were, you talked about your friend saying that you have to be confident, which is not completely wrong, but it was maybe not specific enough. So that's also maybe something that as you improve your vocabulary, it would be easier for you to understand these questions. So I think if I had to give you a score, I would say about a 4.0. So there is room for improvement, but there are positives. Even though a 4.0 is not a particularly high score, I think the fact that you're confident means that you'll be able to take this feedback in a good way and you'll be able to work in the right direction. So that next time you come and do this, you'll be able to get a 5.5 or maybe a 6. I hope so. I think if I can give you good advice, first work on your vocabulary, because that's going to improve your ability to express yourself and it's also going to improve your ability to understand the questions better. Once you've got the vocabulary, that's when you can start worrying about the grammar and the sentence structure. Because even though those things are important, if you don't know the words to use, it doesn't matter if you know the grammar or not. You can know the rules, but if you don't know the words to use, the grammar is useless. So I would always advise students to get the vocab first and then the grammar becomes easier after. Because then you have the tools to build something with. Okay, but otherwise keep going at it. I believe in you. Yeah, thank you. I think you'll get on the road to improve very quickly. Yeah, that's cool. Best of luck to you, man. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
