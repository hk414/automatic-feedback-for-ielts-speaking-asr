 Thank you. Alright, so yeah, let's start with the feedback. So obviously a very good test. I would say your score would be in the 8.5 category today. Yeah, obviously pronunciation and fluency are very strong. Also grammar, there's only like a few small errors that I'll bring you through. In part two, it could have been a little clearer, I think, and you spoke for about a minute and twenty seconds. So in the real test, I would say try to continue speaking for the full two minutes if you can. In terms of grammar, small ones, right? When we talked about the internet, you said you didn't like it at first, but it grew up to me. It grew up to me. The expression is grew on me. It grew on me. When something that you didn't like initially and you started to enjoy, it grew on me. When I talked about, when I asked you the question about your morning routine, is it different from the past and now? I think you said it became a lot more different. I would say it's better to say it has become because you're talking about until now. So you should use the present perfect tense. It has become very different, right? One small mistake, or it was more healthier, obviously just healthier, right? And part two then, just make sure music is an uncountable noun. So you cannot say music, you say music. For example, one sentence, you said it becomes a music to correct that. You would say it becomes a piece of music. So yeah, a piece of music is countable. Just like piece of art. Yeah, piece of art, a piece of music, yes. So yeah, obviously songs are countable. You can say I listened to a few songs, but music is always uncountable. What do we see? Part three, yeah, it was very clear and our good answers. One time he said it's very crucial. Crucial is not a gradeable adjective. So just it's crucial. It's crucial, right? One thing I liked as well, when you, you know, when I asked you a question and you were searching for one word, you know, you were not going to say it. You didn't panic. You were just like, oh, how do I say this? It's hard to explain. I think that's something that students should also do during the test. So that was good. So yeah, overall, good test. Thank you. Thank you very much.
