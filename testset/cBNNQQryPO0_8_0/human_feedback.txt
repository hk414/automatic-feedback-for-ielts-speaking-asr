 Let's talk about their feedback. Let's give you some feedback. But so obviously you lived in New Zealand for a long time. Your English is really clear. Good pronunciation and fluency. Grammar is mostly there as well. One thing I would say is just about the vocabulary. You know when you're doing the IELTS test, if you want to score up, you know, if you're looking for like a nine, you need to use a lot of like phrasal verbs to use some idioms. You did use a lot, yeah, but some of your answers in part one were a little bit simplistic and a little bit repetitive a couple of times. In part one as well, when students are taking the test, try to give like a few sentences for each question and try to give reasons for the answer. But yeah, part two you spoke for a full two minutes and part three you were able to discuss the topics very clearly. So I would just say like whenever students are taking the IELTS test, like simple vocabulary is okay, but try and use a variety. Yeah, variety is important, but yeah, that was a really good test. So thanks for coming in. Thanks for your time. Cheers. Cheers. Thank you.
