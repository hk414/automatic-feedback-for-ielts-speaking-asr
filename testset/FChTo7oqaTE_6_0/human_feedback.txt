 So yeah, let's start with the feedback now. Like I would say your score is estimated to be 6.0. Yeah. A lot of positives, you're very fluent when you speak. You use a lot of nice grammar structures. And there were some good expressions there too. Obviously, you know, everyone's the same when we do the test. There are some maybe inaccuracies with grammar and vocabulary. I'll just point out a few to you now. So we can talk about that. At the beginning when you said you transferred your job once, do you mean you quit your job and move to a different company? Was it? Yeah, it's better to say quit. Yeah, quit. Transfer sounds like, imagine you're in the sole branch of your company and they transfer you to the Busan branch. That sounds more like internal transfer. Mm. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I would say like it's better to say I quit my job. Use the personal pronoun there. So he quit his job. I quit my job. Yeah, and yeah, got a new job. Yeah, change. Yeah, or as you said, change my job is also fine. Yeah. When we use the word relax, I think you were saying a couple of times relax myself. You don't need to put myself at the end there. Just I can relax. Yeah, I can relax. Other words there, you could say I can unwind. I can decompress. They would be good to sit in them to use. Yeah, I can unwind. I can decompress. Yeah, part one was good. Just when we talk about, I talked about your hometown. I asked about your hometown and you were talking about there's a lot of works I had to do and I would probably, yeah, because if you talk for too long in part one, the examiner might cut your answer. Obviously this is just a practice test. So we're just talking about it. But I would more like stick to the question asked, you know. When you say like works, I wouldn't say works plural. I would say singular. I had a lot of work to do. You could say a lot of tasks pluralized. What else do we have to? We talk about vocabulary now if we say the second question was a person who likes to buy goods at low prices. You could definitely use this word frugal. Have you heard this word before? Frugal? People are talking. Yeah, so yeah, the word frugal means someone who is kind of careful with their money. They don't like to waste money. And so yeah, it's not a negative word. It just means someone who's careful with money. So you could use that one. You could use also like inflate the prices. When you talked about, when you go on a trip, you go to some places and they increase the prices for tourists. You could use the word inflate. Yeah, they often inflate the prices for tourists. Yeah. As well, you were saying compromise the price. I think a better word than compromise there would be a haggle. Haggle. Haggle means like to negotiate the price. It's more of, it sounds more like a street market term. The owner tried to sell you for $5 and he used, I'll give you two. That's more like haggling. I just want to say, I want to have what's higher. Wow, it's just maybe a more accurate word to use in that situation. I'm just be careful in part two as well, because it says describe a person. You talked about your mom. But sometimes in part two, you were saying like they, they like saving money. And if I go to a trip abroad, you should talk about focus on your mother, right? Yeah, and back to that expression, trip abroad, you must say go on a trip. Go on a trip abroad. Yeah, go on a trip abroad. Mm, yeah. You're using a lot of good vocabulary as well. A couple of times you're repeating like the most prominent difference, you could say like the main difference or the biggest difference. These are fine to use as well. So instead of like repeating the same vocabulary, try and use a bit of variety. Your pronunciation, it was easy to understand you. There's a few things, maybe like with F and P, like fond of, fond of, yeah. So just maybe you can practice that a little bit. It was a little bit of confusion between the F and P sound. And when we're talking about words like market, apartment, department, the or sound as well, I would practice that one as well, right? So yeah, try and make sure and pronounce the consonant here. But yeah, overall, really good tests and you're a very clear communicator. But with a few things here, you can definitely improve on that. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, cheers. Right.
