3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using discourse markers like "so" and "like" to connect ideas. For example, they use "so" to transition from explaining financial reasons for moving to discussing the benefits of new neighborhoods. However, there are noticeable pauses and repetitions, such as saying "like" multiple times in a short span when explaining Wi-Fi issues. This shows flexibility in maintaining topic relevance but also indicates some effort in organizing thoughts, which aligns with Band 7 features.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, including less common terms like "neighborhoods," "Wi-Fi connection," and "independently." They also use idiomatic expressions such as "really hard to do that" effectively. Their ability to paraphrase, like saying "they usually moved to a new place" instead of repeating "move house," shows awareness of lexical variety. This strong vocabulary use supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "if they have enough money, they can buy a house," but makes frequent grammatical errors. For instance, they say "it will be a greats" (incorrect plural form) and "they usually moved" (incorrect tense). While some sentences are error-free, the frequency of these mistakes affects clarity and precision, placing them in Band 6.5.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. For example, their stress on words like "difficulties" and "independently" is well-placed. However, there are some mispronunciations, such as "neighborhoods" sounding slightly like "neighbor hoods," which can occasionally cause minor confusion. Overall, the pronunciation is effective and supports a Band 7 score.
