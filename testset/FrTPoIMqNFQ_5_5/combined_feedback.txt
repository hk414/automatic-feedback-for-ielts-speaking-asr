Part 2:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with a generally coherent structure, using a range of vocabulary and grammatical forms, though with noticeable hesitation and some grammatical inaccuracies that affect fluency and precision.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates a good ability to speak at length on the given topic, maintaining a relevant focus on their girlfriend's move to a dormitory. They use a range of cohesive devices such as "and," "as," and "so" to link ideas, which contributes to a generally coherent response. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., "I mean like studio room to um dormitory"), which disrupt the natural flow and prevent a higher fluency score. The candidate also repeats phrases like "it is because" and "it gives to my girlfriend's," indicating some effort in organizing thoughts.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a sufficient range of vocabulary for the topic, including terms like "dormitory," "study," "library," and "advantages." They also attempt to use more specific language such as "great impacts or like effects" and "convenient things," showing an effort to vary expression. The vocabulary is generally appropriate and demonstrates an understanding of the topic, with some attempts at paraphrase (e.g., "it is easy to go uh library because it is near with the dormitory"). This lexical range supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences but frequently struggles with grammatical accuracy. For example, "it gives it gives to my girlfriend's to um great impacts or like effects" contains repetition and incorrect preposition use ("gives to"). Other errors include "it is because like dormitory has um um as I recently said two paths and restroom" (confused structure) and "she moved to a new place she moved to I mean like studio room to um dormitory" (repetition and lack of clarity). While some sentences are grammatically correct and show control of basic structures, the frequent errors and limited use of complex forms prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with a natural rhythm and intonation in most parts of the response. They use appropriate stress and connected speech, such as in "it gives to my girlfriend's," which contributes to good intelligibility. However, there are some mispronunciations, such as "paths" for "baths" and "restroom" for "restrooms," which slightly affect clarity. The candidate also uses filler words like "um" and "like" frequently, which is typical for this level but does not significantly hinder understanding.

Part 3:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency and a good range of vocabulary, though occasional hesitation and grammatical errors prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0  
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5  
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5  
   - Pronunciation: 7.0  

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using discourse markers like "so" and "like" to connect ideas. For example, they use "so" to transition from explaining financial reasons for moving to discussing the benefits of new neighborhoods. However, there are noticeable pauses and repetitions, such as saying "like" multiple times in a short span when explaining Wi-Fi issues. This shows flexibility in maintaining topic relevance but also indicates some effort in organizing thoughts, which aligns with Band 7 features.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, including less common terms like "neighborhoods," "Wi-Fi connection," and "independently." They also use idiomatic expressions such as "really hard to do that" effectively. Their ability to paraphrase, like saying "they usually moved to a new place" instead of repeating "move house," shows awareness of lexical variety. This strong vocabulary use supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "if they have enough money, they can buy a house," but makes frequent grammatical errors. For instance, they say "it will be a greats" (incorrect plural form) and "they usually moved" (incorrect tense). While some sentences are error-free, the frequency of these mistakes affects clarity and precision, placing them in Band 6.5.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. For example, their stress on words like "difficulties" and "independently" is well-placed. However, there are some mispronunciations, such as "neighborhoods" sounding slightly like "neighbor hoods," which can occasionally cause minor confusion. Overall, the pronunciation is effective and supports a Band 7 score.
