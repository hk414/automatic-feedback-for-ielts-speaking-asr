3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates a good ability to speak at length on the given topic, maintaining a relevant focus on their girlfriend's move to a dormitory. They use a range of cohesive devices such as "and," "as," and "so" to link ideas, which contributes to a generally coherent response. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., "I mean like studio room to um dormitory"), which disrupt the natural flow and prevent a higher fluency score. The candidate also repeats phrases like "it is because" and "it gives to my girlfriend's," indicating some effort in organizing thoughts.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a sufficient range of vocabulary for the topic, including terms like "dormitory," "study," "library," and "advantages." They also attempt to use more specific language such as "great impacts or like effects" and "convenient things," showing an effort to vary expression. The vocabulary is generally appropriate and demonstrates an understanding of the topic, with some attempts at paraphrase (e.g., "it is easy to go uh library because it is near with the dormitory"). This lexical range supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences but frequently struggles with grammatical accuracy. For example, "it gives it gives to my girlfriend's to um great impacts or like effects" contains repetition and incorrect preposition use ("gives to"). Other errors include "it is because like dormitory has um um as I recently said two paths and restroom" (confused structure) and "she moved to a new place she moved to I mean like studio room to um dormitory" (repetition and lack of clarity). While some sentences are grammatically correct and show control of basic structures, the frequent errors and limited use of complex forms prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with a natural rhythm and intonation in most parts of the response. They use appropriate stress and connected speech, such as in "it gives to my girlfriend's," which contributes to good intelligibility. However, there are some mispronunciations, such as "paths" for "baths" and "restroom" for "restrooms," which slightly affect clarity. The candidate also uses filler words like "um" and "like" frequently, which is typical for this level but does not significantly hinder understanding.
