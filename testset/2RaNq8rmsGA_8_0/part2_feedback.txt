   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally coherent structure, using discourse markers like "so" and "and" to link ideas. However, there are noticeable hesitations and fillers ("um," "like") that interrupt the flow, particularly when explaining her role as a translating manager. While she maintains topic relevance and provides a clear personal example, the pauses and repetition ("those group work and I always try to...") suggest a need for more spontaneous fluency to achieve a Band 8.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of topic-specific vocabulary, using terms like "translating manager," "shooting," "teamwork," and "client" appropriately. She also attempts to paraphrase ("perform their best" instead of "do well") and uses some less common phrases ("make chit-chat"). Her vocabulary is precise and relevant, allowing her to express her ideas clearly, which supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "I always try to assist models so that they can perform their best." However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement ("those should make teamwork"), incorrect prepositions ("give them water"), and awkward phrasing ("I can deliver it to the models"). While these errors do not impede understanding, they prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm that enhances her message. Her stress patterns are generally accurate, and she uses connected speech effectively. There are no significant pronunciation issues that hinder communication, which is consistent with a Band 7 score.
