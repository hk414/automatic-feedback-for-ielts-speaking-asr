3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth and coherent delivery, managing to stay on topic throughout the response. She uses a range of cohesive devices effectively, such as "so," "and," and "because," to link her ideas logically. For example, she connects her role as a translator to the importance of teamwork in a photoshoot, maintaining a clear line of thought. However, there are noticeable pauses and hesitations, such as "um" and "like," which interrupt the flow and suggest she is formulating her thoughts in real-time rather than speaking fluently. This is typical of a Band 7 speaker who can maintain coherence but may not yet achieve the effortless fluency of a Band 8 or 9.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using topic-specific terms like "translating manager," "foreign models," "teamwork," and "perform well" with appropriate precision. She also shows flexibility by using phrases like "give them water" and "have chit-chat with them" to describe her supportive role. Her vocabulary is sufficient for the task and includes some less common items, such as "client" and "poses," which contribute to a Band 7.5 score. However, there is a slight lack of variety in her phrasing, with some repetition of "so" and "those," which could be improved with more sophisticated paraphrasing to reach a higher band.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, such as "I always try to assist models so that they can perform their best," which shows an attempt at grammatical variety. She also correctly uses the present continuous tense ("I am now also working") and the future tense ("I can deliver it"). However, there are several grammatical errors that affect clarity, including "those should make teamwork to perform well" (should be "those should work as a team to perform well") and "I can deliver it to the models" (awkward phrasing). These errors, while not severely hindering understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm that contributes to her overall fluency. Her stress and rhythm are generally accurate, making her speech sound natural and expressive. For example, her intonation rises appropriately when asking "May I start?" and falls naturally at the end of sentences. There are no significant mispronunciations that impede understanding, and her delivery is confident and fluent. This consistent clarity and natural rhythm are characteristic of a Band 7 speaker.
