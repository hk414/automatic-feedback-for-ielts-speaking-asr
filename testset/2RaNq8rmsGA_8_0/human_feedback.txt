 So now we can move on to a little bit of feedback. Yeah, I'm not taking that. So as you probably know, the IELTS exam is scored on four categories. There's fluency and coherence, pronunciation, lexical resource, which is a fancy way of saying vocabulary and grammar. And you did a very good job in all of these categories, but we can talk about each one in a little bit of detail. So in terms of fluency and coherence, very strong, sort of natural rhythm. And in particular, in the beginning, you have very good connections between words and between ideas. So that was very strong. Your pronunciation is very clear. Didn't hear really any words that were pronounced in a natural or incorrect way. So that was very good. You also used a lot of good vocabulary. Talked in part one about broadening your horizons, infrastructure, comparably, which is a nice way to talk about different things. And some good words in part three as well with extra curriculars and talking about kids being socialized, which is a good morphology of social and stigma. So there was a lot of good vocabulary. More good news. Your grammar is good. The only things that jump out sort of throughout are, and they're all very small. The first one would be articles. Articles of course from Korean are very difficult because they don't exist in Korean. In a few cases, the article was dropped. In a couple places, it was added. For example, a few times when you're talking about the subway, I just talked about subway. And sometimes they were added to, I think, at one point in part two, even if it's shooting, like a photo shoot, is a team work. Yeah. So that would be an article that you actually don't need. So those are, that's small. But an important thing. The other sort of grammar point would be around singular and plural. I think he wants to refer to audiences in plural. But often we just talk about audience, the audience. I'm going to meet the audience. Even though there are many people who work with them together. And at one point, in part one of these, I'm pretty a lot, which is close. But you can really just say a lot. Those are the main points on those categories. One part that's maybe, it doesn't relate specifically to these four categories. But in part three, well, sort of, actually, let's go part two first. In part two, you were a little bit short at a minute and I think 21 seconds. So you have up to two minutes. And it's always good to fill that time as much as you can. Because it's an opportunity to show all of the language structures that you can use. And it's actually okay even to hit the two minutes and have the examiner tell you to stop. So that's a minor thing related to the structure of the test. Another thing related to the test itself is that part three, the questions are all very general. And they want you to talk in general about it. But not with a personal example. So the first question there about the jobs that people need to work in a team. I think you gave a personal example, which I can understand because you had just talked about it. But it's always good in that part three to speak generally, sort of at a sociological level rather than a person level. But overall, really, really strong test. I think really strong in the beginning and a few pickups later. But I would estimate your overall score around an 8.0, which is very good. And yeah, you should be proud. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for having me today. Thank you. Thank you.
