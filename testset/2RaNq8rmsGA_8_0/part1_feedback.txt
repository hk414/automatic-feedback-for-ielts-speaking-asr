3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, managing to stay on topic throughout the conversation. She uses a range of cohesive devices such as "but," "so," and "and," which helps link her ideas logically. However, there are noticeable hesitations, particularly when she pauses to think of words ("um," "like") and when she rephrases her thoughts ("I'm trying to like my major because..."). While these pauses do not disrupt the overall coherence, they prevent her from achieving the effortless fluency seen in Band 8 or 9. To improve, she could work on reducing filler words and practicing more spontaneous speaking to build confidence.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using precise and topic-specific terms such as "bilingual MC," "freelance interpreter," "subway," and "amusement park." She also shows flexibility by paraphrasing ideas, for example, saying "I'm trying to like my major" instead of "I'm not sure about it." Her word choice is generally accurate and appropriate for the context. However, there are a few instances where she uses simpler language than her overall ability suggests, such as saying "I always have to go to Seoul" instead of "I always have to travel to Seoul." To reach Band 8, she could incorporate more sophisticated vocabulary and idiomatic expressions naturally.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, including conditional clauses ("if I lend a car, then I would have to pay...") and relative clauses ("the only thing that we have in our city is Everland"). This shows an awareness of grammatical variety. However, there are frequent grammatical errors, such as "I'm trying to like my major because I used to study culture anthropology" (should be "I used to study cultural anthropology") and "I always have to go to Seoul so that's not good 'cause when I'm drunk I have to get back to Yongin" (awkward phrasing and missing articles). These errors are mostly minor and do not impede understanding, but they prevent her from achieving a higher score. To improve, she should focus on mastering subject-verb agreement and article usage.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout the recording. Her intonation is generally natural, with appropriate rises and falls for questions and statements. She uses connected speech effectively, such as linking "I'm trying to like my major" into a single phrase. There are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension. However, her rhythm can be slightly uneven at times, especially when she hesitates or searches for words. To reach Band 8, she could work on varying her intonation more expressively and improving her rhythm to sound more like a native speaker.
