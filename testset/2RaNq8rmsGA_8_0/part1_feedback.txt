1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency, uses a good range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, and is easily understood despite some hesitation and minor grammatical errors.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate generally speaks at length without significant pauses, demonstrating a good ability to maintain the conversation. She uses a range of cohesive devices such as "but," "so," and "whenever" to link ideas, which helps maintain coherence. However, there are occasional hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., "um, I'm trying to like my major because I used to study..."), which slightly disrupt the flow. These features are typical of a Band 7 candidate who can express ideas fluently but may not always speak with complete spontaneity.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using topic-specific terms like "bilingual MC," "freelance interpreter," and "amusement park" with accuracy. She also paraphrases effectively, saying "I'm trying to like my major" instead of "I'm trying to adapt to my major." Her use of phrases like "step out of my comfort zone" and "broaden my horizon" shows good lexical flexibility and idiomatic awareness, which supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "I always get to meet various people like I always work with different clients, different audiences," which shows an effort to vary structure. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement ("I'm trying to like my major because I used to study culture anthropology, but I found out that it's not really my things") and tense inconsistency ("I always have to go to Seoul so that's not good 'cause when I'm drunk I have to get back to Yongin but that's nearly impossible"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout. She uses appropriate intonation and stress patterns, such as emphasizing "Everland" and "Seoul" to convey meaning. Her rhythm is natural, and she uses connected speech effectively (e.g., "I'm kind of stuck in the subway every morning"). There are no persistent mispronunciations that hinder comprehension, which aligns with Band 7 features.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
To reach Band 8, focus on reducing grammatical errors by reviewing subject-verb agreement and tense consistency. Practice speaking more spontaneously to minimize hesitations. To improve pronunciation, work on mastering the correct pronunciation of less common words like "anthropology" and "transfer" to enhance clarity further.
