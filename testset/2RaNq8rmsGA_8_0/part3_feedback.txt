   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates good fluency overall, speaking at length without significant pauses or repetition. She maintains coherence by using discourse markers like "because," "so," and "also" to link ideas logically. For example, she explains her job as an interpreter by connecting her work with clients and audiences, showing a clear thought process. However, there is a slight hesitation when she asks for the question to be repeated, which is a minor break in fluency.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a good range of vocabulary relevant to the topics, such as "teamwork," "preparations," "audiences," and "communicate." She also demonstrates flexibility by paraphrasing, as seen when she says "I always have to ask what they want from me" instead of simply repeating "communicate." Her word choice is generally precise and appropriate, contributing to a strong lexical resource score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "Whenever I go to work, I work with buyers and also I perform in front of the audiences." However, there are some grammatical inaccuracies, like the repetition of "and" in "and also I perform," and the phrase "I always have to ask what they want from me" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. These errors are not frequent enough to hinder understanding but prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. Her stress and connected speech are generally accurate, making her speech sound natural. For example, her intonation rises appropriately at the end of questions and falls at the end of statements. There are no significant pronunciation issues that affect comprehension.
