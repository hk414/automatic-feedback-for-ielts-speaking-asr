1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency, uses a good range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, and is easily understood throughout, though with some hesitation and minor grammatical errors that prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates a good ability to speak at length on a range of topics, maintaining a generally smooth flow with only occasional pauses for thought. For example, when discussing jobs that require teamwork, she uses cohesive devices like "because" and "so" to link ideas logically. However, there are moments of hesitation, such as when she asks the examiner to repeat the question, which slightly disrupts the natural rhythm. Her responses are relevant and well-structured, showing flexibility in organizing ideas, which aligns with Band 7 features.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a wide and appropriate range of vocabulary, including less common terms like "preparations," "audiences," and "communicate," which demonstrates a strong command of lexical items. She effectively paraphrases ideas, such as using "work as a team" instead of repeating "teamwork." Her vocabulary is precise and varied across topics, from jobs to parenting to social skills, which is characteristic of a Band 7.5 candidate.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "I always have to ask what they want from me," which shows some grammatical variety. However, there are noticeable errors, like "I always have to ask what they want from me" (correct) but also "I think all those um all those like process of communications and those stuffs" where "process of communications" is awkward and "those stuffs" is grammatically incorrect. These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and consistent throughout, with good use of intonation and stress that enhances meaning. For example, her stress on "teamwork" and "happy" helps emphasize key ideas. Her rhythm is natural, and she uses connected speech effectively, such as in "I work with buyers and also I perform in front of the audiences." There are no persistent mispronunciations that hinder understanding, which is typical of a Band 7 candidate.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
To reach Band 8, the candidate should focus on reducing hesitation by preparing more concise responses and minimizing fillers like "um." Practicing complex sentence structures with varied conjunctions (e.g., "not only... but also") will improve grammatical range. Additionally, reviewing plural forms and prepositional phrases (e.g., "process of communication" instead of "process of communications") will enhance grammatical accuracy.
