 Thank you. And now let's get into the feedback. So I think you did a lot of great things during your test. So for example, you used a lot of expressions and idioms, which shows a very flexible and proficient command of the English language. So you usually would start your answer with something like, oh, like, I believe, or I think something like that. So it gave a really nice natural lead in to the question. I used expressions like, oh, I didn't really give it a thought. So you know, it just sounds very effortless. And as a listener and as someone who's communicating with you, it just flows very, very well. Okay. You're very welcome. And also you used a good deal of sort of maybe higher level vocabulary. So like you were talking about parents investing into their children, also about children engaging in extracurricular activities. And it was really nice that you expressed it that way rather than say, do after school clubs. You know, it was very, yeah, it was just very good to listen to and it flowed very well. Also you sound very like a natural when you're speaking English. Like it sort of comes effortlessly to you. So I can tell that you put a lot of practice and a lot of time into your English speaking. Okay. Now, there were a few little things here and there. Like I noted one mispronunciation, focus. Yeah. It was just the word stress was slightly in the wrong place, but I could still understand you very easily. So it's not a big deal. And I felt that occasionally maybe there was a little hesitation or maybe you felt a little flustered just because of the question. Maybe. Yeah, yeah, that's it. There you go. Yeah. I'm going to meet that. Yeah. I know some of the questions, it's kind of difficult to answer them on the spot. So I felt that because of that, some answers could have been developed a little bit further. But I think you're part two, which is what a lot of people tend to struggle with. I thought that was really great and you developed that answer very well. And you actually spoke for like one minute and 58 seconds. So yeah, your timing on that was spot on. So overall, considering, yes, there were some points that could be improved. But I think that you showed a very flexible and like expert command of English, to be honest, I would give you about nine. Oh, thank you so much.
