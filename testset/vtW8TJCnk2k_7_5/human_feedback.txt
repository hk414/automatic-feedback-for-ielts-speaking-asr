 So that is everything for your speaking test, and now let's get into the feedback. So you did a lot of things really well in your speaking test. So the things that I noted in particular that you did really well were your pronunciation, okay? Your pronunciation and accent were really, really good. I can tell that you spent a lot of time like practicing speaking English and you have a good amount of experience speaking English. So that definitely worked in your favor. So you did really, really well there, okay? And also some of your expressions. So you used some sort of kind of conversational expressions like as of now and things like that to kind of like introduce your points. You also used I would say quite a few times, so that is quite good. It added to the fluidity of your speech. So that was really, really a good point. And finally another thing I thought that you did really well was the use of like idioms slang and more casual language. So that shows like a level of comfort or ability with the English language. And that would also count in your favor. So you used some words like sweat, jorts and hype up, which you know they're quite idiomatic, right? You're probably not going to find them in a textbook. So it does show that you're very comfortable with the English language and you are knowledgeable on a more idiomatic conversational level. So that is all really good. Some of the things that I thought that you could work on and improve upon was that while yes, you did use some like good idiomatic language, there weren't a lot of like higher level expressions, right? So it might have just been like the specific questions or in nerves, but I felt like you could have included some more higher level grammatical structures and vocabulary, okay? I also noticed a lot of hesitation, which again might have been from the questions or nerves. Yeah. Yeah, that can happen sometimes. So that's just something to work on. If you want to get more comfortable doing this kind of test, okay? Oh yeah. And I also noticed a lot of um, yeah, and stuff. So yeah, these are like habitual things. Yeah, that's what I have it. Yeah, native speakers do that too quite frequently and a lot, but to really improve your like fluency and coherent score, it's best to kind of work on reducing that, okay? Okay. Yeah. And I noticed there was like you said the technology has grown up. People can say that, but usually we talk about grown up like a person grows up. In the case of technology, we usually use developer advanced. So there was just one like inappropriate expression I would say. But overall, you did really well. And if you work on that kind of like that side of the fluency and coherence elements, as well as improving your electrical resource and use of grammatical structures, I think you could increase your score, okay? Okay. So for today, I gave you a 7.5 out of 9. All right. Yeah, thank you.
