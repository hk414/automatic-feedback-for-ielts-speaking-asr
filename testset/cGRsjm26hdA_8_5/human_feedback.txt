 Let's start with the feedback. So I'd say estimate your score today to be 8.5. There's just a few small errors, but most of all it was very comfortable, very clear, very nice fluency and pronunciation. You use a lot of nice vocabulary and your grammar was almost perfect. I'll just run you through a few things that maybe we could improve on. In your part one question, try to explain a little bit more and explain why and give some reasons and examples. So I think some of your answers were a little bit short, even though they were perfectly answered. One point when I asked you about how often do you eat chocolate? You said five times a month and you said I'm trying to cut down on chocolate. So cut down is more like reducing. So maybe I used to eat 10 times now, 8, 5 times. Maybe a better word would be like limit, limit the amount of chocolate that I eat because I don't want to gain weight. Okay, yeah, that was good with part one. Part two, so you spoke for a minute and ten seconds. In the real test, you should try to speak towards two minutes. So two minutes is the maximum time, so we could try and maybe develop the last point a little bit more if we can. One point we said, right, so a close that I ordered online, right? So you can say like address that I ordered online, but you can say a close. So you could say some close that I ordered online or address. I shopped it online. You could only say like I bought it or I ordered it. We do use shop as a verb, but we put it together as shop four, shop four. So like last week I went shopping for something. Maybe like one time you said they was replied, just will delete the V verb and they replied and they offered a full refund and you were very satisfied. Okay, so there's a couple of small things there. When you talk about online offline, so yeah, we do say shopping online for offline. I think it's more common to say shopping in stores, yeah, or people say like at a brick and mortar store, maybe you could also use that. One thing, I asked you why do people not like to make complaints? You said maybe they don't like talking about negative things. That's fine. We could also say like the word confront. They don't like to confront people. They avoid confrontation. Maybe that would be good there. Okay, and just one word for pronunciation was perfect. Basically the whole way. One word was that when you talk about music, genres, genres, yeah, that's a tricky one. Also maybe in part three, like most of your sentences started with I think. So maybe we could try and vary the vocabulary a little bit from my perspective, I would say in my opinion. But yeah, really good test overall. So thank you. Thank you. All right.
