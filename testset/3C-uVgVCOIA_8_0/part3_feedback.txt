3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, managing to stay on topic throughout the response. They use a range of cohesive devices like "basically," "and," and "so" to link ideas, which helps maintain coherence. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections, such as "um" and "the the," which interrupt the natural rhythm and prevent a higher score. The topic development is logical but could be more sophisticated with better sequencing of ideas.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using specific terms like "nerve disability," "car accident," and "brain chip" to describe their chosen job. They also use less common phrases like "it would be done" and "doing hard work," showing an attempt at varied expression. The vocabulary is generally precise and appropriate for the topic, allowing for clear communication of complex ideas.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "the brain and the body cannot be fully connected because of the accident, physically." However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues ("the people are doing hard work for doing that"), incorrect prepositions ("in the company is that in the field"), and awkward phrasing ("the the"). While these errors don't significantly hinder understanding, they prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand. They use appropriate stress and intonation to convey meaning, such as emphasizing "Neuralink" and "brain chip." There are no persistent mispronunciations that cause confusion. However, some words are slightly unclear, like "nerve" and "car accident," and the rhythm can be uneven due to hesitations, which slightly affects overall fluency.
