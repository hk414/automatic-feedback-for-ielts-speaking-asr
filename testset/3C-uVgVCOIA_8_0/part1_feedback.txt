3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates a generally fluent speaking style with a good pace and natural rhythm. They are able to maintain the topic and provide extended answers, such as when explaining their job preferences and hometown. However, there are noticeable pauses and hesitations, particularly when searching for words ("um," "uh"), which slightly disrupt the flow. The use of cohesive devices is functional but limited, with a reliance on basic connectors like "and" and "so," which prevents a higher score.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate displays a good range of vocabulary relevant to the topics discussed. They use specific terms like "Italian dish," "pasta," "bath town," and "commute," showing an ability to paraphrase and use topic-specific language effectively. Their vocabulary is generally precise and appropriate, contributing to clear communication. To reach Band 8, the candidate could incorporate more idiomatic expressions and less common collocations to demonstrate greater lexical flexibility.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, such as "I always went to Seoul to have fun with my friends," which shows an attempt at varied grammar. However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues ("I always went to Seoul to have fun with with my friends"), incorrect prepositions ("the reaction between them"), and tense inconsistencies ("I always went to Seoul to have fun with with my friends"). While these errors do not impede understanding, they prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and stress patterns that contribute to natural-sounding speech. They articulate words accurately and maintain a consistent rhythm throughout their responses. The pronunciation of specific terms like "Annyeong" and "pasta" is correct, and there are no significant issues with connected speech. To improve, the candidate could focus on mastering more complex phonological features, such as linking and reduction, to achieve a more native-like rhythm.
