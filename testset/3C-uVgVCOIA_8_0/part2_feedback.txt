3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates a good ability to speak at length on the given topics, maintaining a generally smooth flow of ideas. For example, when discussing confusing text messages, the candidate provides a detailed personal anecdote about receiving a fake message claiming their father was taken, which shows effective topic development. However, there are noticeable hesitations, such as "um" and "uh" fillers, and a slight repetition when first asking for clarification ("Pardon?"). While the candidate uses some cohesive devices like "for example" and "so," the overall coherence is occasionally disrupted by these pauses, which is characteristic of a Band 7 speaker who can maintain topic development but with some effort.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate displays a strong and flexible vocabulary, using precise and appropriate terms. Notable examples include "absurd," "deceive," and "emotional reaction," which demonstrate a good command of less common vocabulary. The candidate also uses idiomatic language effectively, such as "basically a lie," to convey meaning clearly. The vocabulary is varied and well-suited to the topics discussed, allowing for clear expression of ideas, which is a key feature of a Band 7.5 speaker.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex grammatical structures, such as the conditional "if they try to deceive people" and the relative clause "the text message with other people you cannot share the emotional reaction." However, there are frequent grammatical errors that affect accuracy. For instance, the candidate says, "the the for example" and "the the weird messages I got," which shows a lack of control over basic sentence structure. Additionally, there are issues with articles ("the the") and word order ("there are there's so many bad people out there"). These errors, while not impeding overall understanding, prevent the candidate from achieving a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm that contributes to the natural flow of speech. The candidate's stress and rhythm are generally accurate, making their speech sound fluent and expressive. For example, the phrase "my father was taken" is delivered with appropriate stress and intonation. There are no significant pronunciation issues that hinder comprehension, which is a hallmark of a Band 7 speaker.
