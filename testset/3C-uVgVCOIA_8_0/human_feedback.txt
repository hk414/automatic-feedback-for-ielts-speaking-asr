 the experience of living and working in other countries? Actually, I don't have an experience having a job in other countries, so I'm not really sure about this question, but I guess it would help because the having a job in other countries helps people with the broadening deals they're sent for perceiving the world. I think it's a huge difference. For example, when you don't have any experience and just stay in one country and have a job and stay in their entire life in the one country, it is also good, but in order to do the bigger thing, such as the making of business, the exporting products, I think there is a limitation on that. If someone is interested in, what would you say, the company which provides the product to other countries, I think the working of the country helps a lot. But why are some people unwilling to work in other countries? Again, I think this depends on a person, but based on my personal experience, some people are not interested in working in other countries because they are shy and they are not confident. There are people who want to have a job in other countries, but they are not confident to do that. Basically, because of the language, the other thing is that they are obsessed with being a perfect person. I think nobody can be perfect. If you are obsessed with this thing, they cannot do anything in any field, including anything. I think the working in other countries, the lack of confidence is the fundamental thing. What is the difference between working in an international company and working in a domestic company? I think the biggest difference is the culture. When you say domestic country in Korea, obviously, the culture in that company will be more unlike the Korean culture, such as there are much more strict hierarchy based on age. On the other hand, for the international companies, I guess I don't have an experience on having a job in an international country, but I think it would be much more and lose the Korean country. The cultural thing will be the biggest difference, I think. Okay, good. The end. Thank you. Nicely done. Okay, now we can move on to some feedback. As you probably know, the IELTS have scored on four categories. There's fluency and coherence, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. We can move through each of them individually to start. In terms of fluency, very strong. You really don't have any... A lot of times, this is about pausing. You don't have any pauses. You speak plenty fast. If anything, I would maybe even recommend speaking a little bit slower. Sometimes that helps you form the answer, but it can help the listener track the answer and track the main points and sort of organize it. Plenty fast. If anything, maybe even a little slower. I thought in part two, in particular, there were times when you were almost hurrying to say more. Yeah. So, very good, but perhaps lower. Peronciation is very good. Really no... I mean, there's no errors per say. The only thing that you could perhaps do is annunciate a little bit more. And so, annunciate is to pronounce each syllable of a word. You'd clearly and loudly, and to project your voice a little bit. To explain a little more, Korean can often be spoken without moving your lips very much. But English requires more movement, which can create a slightly clearer sound. I understood everything you said, but it could project further with sort of greater mouth movement, which is sort of the annunciation aspect, but very good. Overall, your vocabulary, also good, excellent range of words to describe some complex things to, including, you know, neural link technology is pretty complicated stuff. So, that plenty of vocabulary to do that. If anything, maybe adding more idioms, more idioms in sort of natural conversational expressions is possible, but not really a concern per say. And your grammar is pretty good too. Again, I don't see... Or, it didn't hear errors per say. It was mostly very good, and there was a good range of phrases and constructions. The only one thing, and this is really small, is that you might overuse the definite article. So the definite article is the... Articles are very hard coming from Korean, of course. They're authentic in Korean and there are articles in English. But a few times you've referred to, you know, cooking the garlic pasta, living in the soil, referred to something as the bed town, and the communication with family, I think, those were four instances where actually you wouldn't need to use an article of error. Because the pasta would just be a general, like, garlic pasta. It's just... Yeah, yeah. It's not one specific one. There is only one soul, so it's not the soul versus another soul, it's just soul. The bed town, you would probably describe it as A bed town. A bed town. A bed town, because there are actually many bed towns. So slight overuse of the definite article, but that's a really, really small thing. So that's kind of the language feedback. Let's see. There are two things about just sort of taking the test. In part three, these questions are designed to be very general and very broad. So you want to try to avoid using personal experience. I think in a few answers, you try to kind of be dealing with personal experience or personal perspective. But you want to try... The questions are phrased in such a way that you can talk about people generally. So what kind of young people... What kind of work could young people do in foreign countries? Leaving yourself completely out of it. People might work in a restaurant or they might work in a hotel or those kind of things. So you want to avoid your experience. And that's really it. That's really it. This was a very good test, a very capable speaker. But based on all of this, I would estimate your score today at around 8.0, which is very good. With some minor sort of modifications, it could be even higher. But really nicely done. And thanks for coming in.
