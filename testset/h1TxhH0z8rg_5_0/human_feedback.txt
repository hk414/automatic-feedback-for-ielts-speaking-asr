 All right, so let's start with to give you some feedback about it. So I would estimate your score to be 5.0 today. Yes, a lot of good things you answered all the questions pretty clearly. I was able to like understand your ideas. The main thing is that the grammar needs to be a little bit tighter. You know, there's like for example in the part one, there was a lot of like present tense and past tense like mixing up and some I&G kind of all together in there. So try and just be you know, listen carefully to the question and try to answer exactly the way it's asked. Just point out a few things to you in terms of like grammar and phrasing issues, right? One thing is your hometown which is or somewhere which is nearby Seoul. So we shouldn't say nearby Seoul. We should say near Seoul. Okay. Near Seoul. Nearby is used as an adjective phrase. For example, the cafe is nearby. Well, we don't have to put anything after that. So it's very confusing near nearby but I would look at some examples. I feel boarding is another one. It should be the ED. I feel bored. I feel excited. I feel tired. Yeah, you know about that. Just some phrasing issues as well. When you talked about with your friends, you said like we have small talk. Yeah. Instead of small talk with friends, I would say we have a chat. Yeah, small talk is usually like making a conversation with a stranger. You know, when you when you get into the elevator with your neighbor, you make some small talk like that. Other one would be when you talked about shopping, right? Online shopping. People can't fit them. I would probably use the phrasal verb here. Try on. Yeah. So when you shop online, you can't try on the product. You can't try on the clothing. You talked about fashion as well. Outlook should be outfit. Yeah. Outfit. They're outfit. Yeah. There are a few good expressions there as well. When you said about the staff, staff pushing their customers. Okay. The good point. I would probably say I would use the adjective form. I would say pushy. So sometimes staff are too pushy to try to encourage you to buy something. Okay. Yeah. Good, good pronunciation. I would say there's a few words. Now, let's say like a modern, modern photograph, transportation. Is there a few like isolated words that I think you should practice? And there is some issue with the or an L sound as well. Yeah. So again, just, you know, something we need to practice. Okay. Thank you for coming in and doing the test. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.
