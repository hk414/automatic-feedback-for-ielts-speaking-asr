 All right, so the score for this candidate will give is 7.0. Fluency was very strong. There were only a few instances of hesitation throughout. And the hesitation was more about thinking about the answer rather than looking for the word or searching for language related issues. That was good. Well, CAB was a few good expressions here. So, you know, one one natural expression that I picked out was like as a side job, you know, very natural spoken expression. There were also some fillers when she wasn't sure of what to say. She was saying like, oh, what else? My hometown, what kind of food. So it's quite natural. Instead of having this silence, she showed that she was actually thinking about content rather than the word. For pronunciation, there are some some issues there. There was some like with TH. So things were pronounced maybe more like just like a T sound teams and the for example a short A sound like happen was a little bit of her first language was coming into that. But there were no issues with really understanding. There were a couple of isolated words were not pronounced correctly. One was legend and media. So I think those were the only isolated words were not really pronounced correctly. In terms of grammar. Again, it's all very easy to understand uses a flexible range, but mistakes were persisting throughout the interview. So small small mistakes such as articles, you know, there was a lot of times where a and the weren't included in the speech. So again, the meaning is very clear, but the articles were not there. In terms of tense sometimes, you know, for example, in the first part, I traveled to over 25 countries. That should be the present perfect tense. Like I've traveled to I've been to over 25 countries. Some like word choice. She said below my city below my city probably say a south of my city north of my city. So if you're talking about location, I would go with south north and east west. What else we have. Sometimes we're not hearing the the plural sound. So I was hearing he drive instead of he drives. So again, like smaller throughout part three give money to charity give money to charity is fine, but a better word will be donate donate money to charity. So overall good test. Yeah, finish up at that.
