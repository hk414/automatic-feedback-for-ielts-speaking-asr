 Three. Yes. So yeah, let's talk about the feedback. Yes. There's some negative things, but there's a lot of positive things as well. Yes. So my predicted score for you would maybe be around five to five point five. Yes. For the time being. The reason for that. Unfortunately, in part one, there were quite a few long pauses in your answers. So when we try and work out your speaking score, one of the criteria is, are you pausing a lot when you are trying to give me answers? So I think that unfortunately hurt your score a little bit. Some long pauses there. In a few questions, you were repeating certain words a lot, especially I think with the first or the second question about your home type. You said the same thing like there's lots of old people for example. You said that two or three times and you said there's lots of mountains a couple of times too. So unfortunately they do look at those things, but I feel like that improved as the test went along. I think you started to maybe become less nervous. So you stopped doing that, which is a positive thing. One thing that kind of hurt you here is limited vocabulary. Yes. You are very enthusiastic when you're communicating with me, which is a very positive thing. But I think at this stage your vocabulary is very limited. So I can feel that you have many things to tell me, but you don't have the words to express it. And I think if you're looking at scores like 6.5, you do need to expand your vocabulary. So that is something you can focus on as you prepare more. It's through study a lot of vocabulary. Even though it might seem a basic thing to do, it really helps students to improve their scores. Because the more words you know, the easier it is to express your feelings. You don't have to think about what you say as much because you already know the words. Yes. So I would definitely advise you to focus on learning some vocabulary. And one little issue was also one of the questions there. I think you misunderstood it a little bit. Such as, is this city your permanent residence? So that question means do you stay in that city permanently? You don't move to other parts. For example, you don't have a house in one city, but during the week time. Maybe you live in a Goshiwando or something or a dormitory. So while you study, you live in the dormitory, but on weekends you go back home. So the question is asking if you're doing that. But in your case, I could at least understand you live in your city all the time. You don't have a different accommodation. So I think they might penalize you a little bit on that as well for misunderstanding the question. But it's not major major. It's just something to focus on in the future. Then unfortunately your part 2 was too short. Yes. It was only one minute 20. Yes. So we're trying to get you to speak for a full two minutes. Oh, right. So anything under like one minute 45, that would be too short. Yes. So some advice I could give you on how to increase your speaking time. Explain what your master's is. I think your master's is safety, master's of safety, right? For someone like me, I don't really know what that means. So it is likely your examiner might also not fully know what that is. Take some time to explain what is it in one of the prompts. Tell me what is a master of safety. Is it like a safety officer in construction or is it safety when in like a military capacity? Like what kind of safety are we talking about? There's lots of types of safety. So you could explain that for example. That would increase your speaking time quite a lot. You can also tell me about some personal feelings. Like you said that you feel very cool about working towards this goal. That's good. But you can explain a bit more. Like is it something you're proud of? You think one day you'll enjoy it to do this job. You will feel very satisfied when you have it. But yeah, those are the negative things. The positive things in part three especially you used comparisons. The spring. An ambitious guy is like a spring. That's really good. That's what we're looking for. So comparing things that usually increases your grade. So that was a very positive thing. Like I said before, you're very enthusiastic. Like I can see you're engaged. You want to have this conversation. That's a good thing. Even the fact that you used the word homies for your friends. That's a bit of natural English. And we are looking for a natural sounding person as well. So those are the positive things. I think if you can increase your vocabulary by just doing that. By studying that you would have more things to say. You would express yourself better. I think you can move from 5.5 into the 6th band. By improving your vocabulary. Oh, there. Yeah. Yeah. So that's it from my side. Oh, thank you. That's a pleasure, man. Good luck going forward. Yeah, thank you.
