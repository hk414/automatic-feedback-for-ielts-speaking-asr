 5.5 getting close to 6.0 I think but it's maybe to be a bit cautious I would go 5.5 today You did well in the test you answered all the questions well Sometimes fluency was a little bit the low point it was some hesitation It wasn't too bad and just in general some grammar errors that I will just take you through now so Obviously everybody makes grammar errors, but I'm just gonna point out something to you today So it might help you improve for the next time all right Terms of grammar is right one time you said I'm preparing for studying abroad. Yeah, I'm preparing for studying abroad You know, yeah, you do say prepare for I'm preparing for my exam. I'm preparing for my holiday But study abroad you can use it as a verb So it's better to say I'm preparing to study abroad I'm preparing study abroad Other things your apartment you says it's in the first floor should be on the first floor It's on the second floor on the third floor whatever. Yep Other things what else have we furniture furniture is an uncomfortable noun So when you say too many furniture we can't say that too much furniture Yeah, I've got too much furniture in my so in my apartment you could like use You know sofa and chair on table they're countable, but the the group furniture is uncomfortable now. Yeah, what else do we have? Um, so one phrasing you use at the end of part one you said it is clear that I don't change my opinion You would use the phrase it is clear that for something that Everybody knows, but you know since this is kind of your personal opinion. I wouldn't use that expression. Yeah Um Other things with countable uncomfortable you said I gained too many weight Too much yeah, I gained weight after COVID appeared Better word than appeared You could say yeah, you could say started or you could say broke out Yeah, after it broke out appeared as something like kind of like, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it did kind of appear, but anyway Yeah, um, what else do we have here? He said in the internet should be always on the internet on the internet Uh pronunciation Sometimes right with the ed verbs. Okay For example changed watched right when I hear the pronunciation sometimes I hear change it or what should So just be careful it should be just like once a level changed watched So I would I would practice the ed Uh ed verbs with that Uh one let's let's talk about one bit of vocabulary. Okay, so the part two question was about promise, right? I think the Korean word is Yaksok, isn't it? Yeah, right Right, so in Yaksok would be in English. Maybe it's better to say like plan or appointment Okay, so let's look at it in a few different ways first So plan is something more casual right? So I have a plan with my friend tonight after work appointment is something more Official yeah more formal like I want to doctor the appointment. Then there's the appointment right the word Promise though promises more like a commitment to something, you know Yeah, so I asked you the question what kind of promises do people make? So Yaksok would not be a good answer at this time, right? The promise would be like maybe parents promise their children they will study hard or children promise To come home at a certain time Promise is more like a commitment to something So I wouldn't use like a time promise for that question So yeah, I think It sometimes gets confusing Promise plan and appointment. I think we need to look at the difference between those. Yeah, well, we'll look at it together after anyway Korean promise plans and appointment or Yaksul all right right right. Yeah, yeah, no, I get you. I get you But people would never say like I have a promise tonight. They say I've got a plan tonight. Yeah, I've got plans Yeah, so yeah, we'll I'll give you some examples after as well. Okay. Oh, yeah, all right. Nice one. Yeah, we'll finish up But thanks for coming in. Cheers Thank you so much. Thank you
