 right as you're doing the test obviously I'm taking some notes and you know you're graded on four parts fluency, vocab, pronunciation and grammar. Let's say you're overall scored today the estimate will be a 6.0 today. In terms of fluency obviously there was some hesitation in it but I think it wasn't too bad especially in part one and part three you were able to speak comfortably about the most topics. I'd say what we want to work on is there some grammarers we'll just look at some of these here okay so I was a student just articles here so just make sure I was a student in that situation. I currently start work so start work would be in the past so make sure you say I started work a few weeks ago or I'm currently working so currently is always present tense with that. I'm enjoying to work there so I'm enjoying working. After enjoy you always have i-n-g as you probably know this one's maybe a little tricky one okay you talked about Changwon okay so Changwon where is in the southern part of Korea so when we use this clause we can't say where we have to say which we only use where if there is an action verb in this sense so for example Changwon is the city where I met my friend okay but you're just describing your hometown Changwon which is in the southern part okay when I get stressed just sometimes here between I'm and I just so when I get stressed when I get stressed articles sometimes as well they're quite difficult I think the and so when you're talking about something in general make sure you just use the plural tense compared to expensive products okay not the expensive one another one here was using another okay so you said another country's food we could say you know international food foreign food maybe exotic food make sure as well with another it's always singular another country other countries other drinks so I'll go through these with you properly anyway but you can have a look at this yourself pronunciation was generally good as well not nothing really stood out as incorrect but that was okay vocabulary I think it's enough for 6.0 but there was some you know repetition of the same words and you know if you wanted to get a higher score we need to try and level up a little bit with that but in general it was a good test yeah did well in front of the camera yeah all right thank you thank you thank you
