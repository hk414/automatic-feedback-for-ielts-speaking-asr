 But all right, so for the feedback parts, really good test, I would have estimate your score to be at least 7.5 on up, yeah, around that. I'll just point out a few grammar things that will look at, right? When you're talking about a month, you were saying this year on June, on January, to be in for the month. All right. That's always confusing. Yeah, so good. The problem in January, in June. The other one you said a couple of times, right? It depends on people. It should be, it depends on the person. So every time you use depends on, you should use the plus singular now. OK. Depends on the weather, depends on the person, whatever. Yeah, good expression. I'm weak at singing, that's fine. No problem. But maybe a better expression would be, I don't have a good voice. Or I can't hit the high notes. Or try to use expressions related to the topic. That'd be good. OK. I don't know what that expression, but if we want to just upgrade our vocabulary a little bit. Right. What are we saying? During those period, it should be that period. That period. I know it's multiple months, but it's one period. OK, yes. Yeah, on part two, I suggest you describe a photo. So I'd be more specific, again, about one photo. But it was really difficult to choose. Right. Yeah, yeah. It's a hard one to choose again. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would say definitely in the second part, just try and focus on one and describe it totally and clearly. OK. But yeah, that was always good. Just the last one in part three, I think there was a little bit of misunderstanding. The question was, why do people dislike taking photos? So taking photos means the person actually taking the camera. Ah, OK. I think you are answering. People don't like getting their photos taken. Yes, yes. So just between like active and passive. No, no problem. Like, I think that's a common error. So taking photos or getting photos taken. OK. I'll go with that. He said, making their name card, maybe a better expression would be like online portfolio. Oh, OK. People can make their online portfolio through uploading, pictures and videos. It's easy to remind of. OK, it's easy to maybe a better word would be recall here. Recall. It's easy to recall moments, recall memories. Yeah. But that was really good overall. Nice tests. So thank you for coming in. Thank you. Cheers.
