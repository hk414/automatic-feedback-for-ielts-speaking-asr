 Thank you. And now we can move on to a little bit of feedback. So as you know, the aisle to score down to four parts, there's fluency and coherence, there's pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. I think you did a nice job on all of these categories, but we can just comment on each quickly. We'll start with the first two that are the easiest. Fluency and pronunciation are both very strong. You've got a natural rhythm of speech and no pronunciation issues at all, really. So those are both very strong. Vocabulary and grammar are often linked. It can be hard to actually say exactly what's a vocabulary thing, what's a grammar thing. Broadly speaking, I think it was quite good. You have a good control of the present and the past tense. Good accuracy for the most part. And there's kind of two ways that you wanna think about is accuracy and then there's range. So accuracy, whether there are errors and range, whether you're reaching for idioms and natural phrases and very advanced vocabulary. The errors that you made were very small. In part one, for example, the question about your hometown, might have been a little misunderstanding. I think you wanted to, you could just say soul is your hometown. I know soul is not a town, but hometown just refers to the place where you grew up. That would have made that question a little bit easier because you can talk more generally about the city. But I guess that's a vocabulary thing in a way. When you were describing the train too, you described it as two crowded, which is true in a good way to describe it. But there's more advanced words that you could have used as well in that position to advance your score. Could have described it as cramped, you could have described it as claustrophobic, could say it's suffocating. And reaching for these slightly more advanced phrases is good for progressing in your score. In terms of grammar, let's see, small things. At one point, you mentioned that something was more better. So it's just better. A little bit of using comparatives is actually very good on the exam. It shows the level of accuracy and range. So those questions that ask you to compare the festivals now and festivals in the past, that's a good place to use comparative forms. The more better was a, that was a part one question, but again, it's an accuracy. Really small other things, plurals and singulars. You mentioned that the part, there was a lot of, there were lots of darts. And darts is not countable. Yeah. Dirt is not countable. So those are small little accuracy things that might hold you back just a little bit. One other point would be that in part three, part three is hard because you get these general questions and they want you to talk generally without using your own example. So you want to avoid using an eye statements or approaching it from a personal perspective and try to keep it as general as possible. It can be hard because the questions come from various different angles. But yeah, overall, I think it was a very good test and I would estimate your score at around 7.5, but very strong, 7.5. And with a little bit of extra refining on the vocabulary, little more advanced phrases you'd be able to move up. So very good job and thanks for coming in. Oh, thank you. All right, take care.
