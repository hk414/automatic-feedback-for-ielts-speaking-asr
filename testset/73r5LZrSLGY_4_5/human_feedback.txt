 or the, might be like 4.5 today, a little lower than you expected, I think. But there's a couple of things you just need to improve, right? A lot of positives as well, you're very fluent, you know? There's no hesitation. You answered all the questions quite well with just a few exceptions. But yeah, strong point is definitely your fluency. But the other side, we need to work on the grammar. We know that, you know that yourself, yeah. Like, subject, verb, agreement sometimes, like the basic ones, you know, we need to study them and be a little bit tighter, you know? For example, a common one that you were saying, like, I'm really like, blah, blah, blah. So I'm really like hot weather. So, you know, yourself, I really like hot weather. Yeah, so make sure we have no form of to-be there. So I really like hot weather. Like, for example, don't end doesn't. They don't, he doesn't. These things need to be a little bit tighter, yeah? What else do we got? If I have a free time, make sure there's no A there, just free time. That's a common one. Other things we're looking at here, plurals as well. You were not adding the S to a lot of your sentences, you were saying like, for example, three time a week, three times a week, yeah, sometimes, sometimes, I don't like games, I don't like games. Yeah, so plurals would be one thing, you know, subject verb would be another thing. So grammar needs to be a little bit tighter, yeah? A little bit tighter. Vogue-up, any issues with vocab? One was like, you said pocket ball. I know you use that word in Korean. I think in English it's better to say pull. Yeah, P-O-L, yeah. So you play pool with your friend. In other words, when you said small people, it shouldn't be small, what should it be? A few. Few people. Yeah, the countryside is few people, few people in there. Yeah. And just be careful with some of the questions, you know, in part one I said, what's the weather like? Where you live? So you should describe the weather in your hometown, rather than the weather that you like, right? So just be careful with that. And there was another one in part one as well when we were talking about, yeah, there's another one about social media. So just make sure the question was about, do you think you or your friends use it too much? And you started talking about like children in general. So make sure and listen to the subject of the question. Also in part three, in part three, many of your answers you were talking about your situation. But you know, part three should be more general, like people in your country. So really be careful in part three. I think for example, like the last one, like what do people consider important? And you said like, oh, I think kitchen is important. So make sure you focus on the subject of the question. So yeah, I'd say your score is probably around 4.5. It couldn't even go up to five, I would say, but it's just because of the part three's, I think if they were answered a bit better than maybe. But yeah, a lot of positives, but we know grammar needs to be tighter. Yeah, you know yourself, man. All right, got to lose. Thank you. Thank you.
