 to a little bit of feedback. As you know, the IELTS test is scored on four categories. There's fluency and coherence. There's pronunciation, vocabulary, or in lexical resource, and grammar. So thinking of these four categories, there's two that stand out for you as really strong. Your fluency and your pronunciation is very good. There's really no hesitation beyond what we would expect for somebody who's thinking of what to say. And I didn't notice a single word that was pronounced in an unusual or non-standard way. So both of those are really strong. The only thing perhaps is that within fluency, there's also coherence, which is sort of connective words that can help string together, longer answers, and connect parts of it, and show the relationship. So perhaps adding some of those would help, but your fluency, the actual rate of speech, is very good in the pronunciation. So then there's vocabulary and grammar. These are not bad, not leaving them because they're bad. They're both actually quite good. Let's take vocabulary first. Mostly excellent. The only thing as you reach into the higher bands would be to add more unusual or less common words. You can also try to add more idioms. I think you had some, but adding idioms to give a natural sound to your speech. There's a little bit of room for improvement there. And there's a few small grammar things. None of them that interfere with meaning, and I could understand everything that you said, which is really important. But a couple of small things, a few times articles were dropped. That's very common from a Korean first language because there are not articles in Korean, but always remembering to put an A or an A or the A before certain words is important. You had a lot of good use of the past tense in part two when you were describing experience, and that's good. A few small things around prepositions. I think as you're describing the train, you might have said, people bang on you. The phrase there would be bang into you, sort of colliding. And one error around too much and too many. I think you might have said too much people, but it would be too many people. But otherwise, honestly, really, really good. I would estimate your score around a 7.0 today, which is a very good score. And with a little bit of improvement around those areas, would reach even higher. So really nicely done. And thanks for coming in. Thank you.
