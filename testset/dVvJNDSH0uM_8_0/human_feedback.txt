 So now let's get into the feedback from your speaking test. So you did really well. Let's go through it, section by section. So for part one, you answered all of the questions. There were a few small mistakes. So for example, instead of return, you would say get it back. Or you also said you take the shoes for four years. Yeah, but usually we would say I would use the shoes for four years or keep them. For the second part, the extended response. Yeah, you did really well. There weren't many errors in that part at all. And you spoke very fluently and confidently, which is great. And finally, for the third part, again, really fluid, very confidence. You did really great. Just for the last question, you said there will be a circulation. Yeah. So usually we use circulation for like air movements or something like that. So usually when we describe trends, we say they cycle. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I forgot about that. And it's okay. It's just a very, very small nuance. Yeah. But overall, you did great. So I would score you in eight on the aisle spans. Oh, okay. Thank you. Yeah. I knew that there are some grammatical errors. I haven't specialized in grammar, but more I was focused on more speaking. So that's why. But yeah, thank you for the feedback. You're very welcome. I hope you have a great day. You too. Thank you. Thank you.
