 So now let's get into the feedback. Okay, so you did a lot of things really well during your test. So first of all, I really want to compliment you on your confidence. You spoke English very confidently and I can tell you very comfortable using the English language when speaking. So you did a great job there. And during the test, I felt you got a lot more comfortable as the test progressed. So even though usually like part three is thought of as being like harder and part two as well, I think as the test progressed, you got more and more comfortable with speaking. So that's great. And at some points you did maybe hesitate a bit or get confused, but I felt you corrected yourself really well. Also your vocabulary choice was quite appropriate. I didn't note any like words that were maybe awkward or inappropriate. So you did very well there. And you used like a few like kind of more like kind of conversational things like saying cause and like we were literally zero, but that's actually like a good thing because it sounds natural, okay? So good job there. On the other side, I felt like your part two was a little on the short side. So you have two minutes and you used around one minute, twenty seconds. All right. I feel like you could make that a little bit longer with practice, okay? In terms of grammar, there were some mistakes which were present throughout the test. So for example, these, I want to say that these are really common mistakes, but I think you can fix them really easily should you want to. Okay. So for example, S's. So you said like these day, not these days. Or when you were talking about your month, you should have said newborn baby bees. Yeah. Just things like that, okay? So that was one point. Also the articles. So sometimes I felt like you were dropping the article, but in English, the article is quite important. So like the and ah, right? So we went to same kindergarten, but you should say we went to the same kindergarten, right? Or the same middle school. And also the verb tense. So you said like I sell my galaxy watch. Yeah. But it should be I sold my galaxy watch. And I know these are all things that you are aware of, but maybe with nerves, it is kind of easy to let these things slip. But yeah. So those were like the main points where you could improve. And at some points, you felt a little bit flustered, but as I said previously, you did recover well. Okay. So I think maybe working on the nerves and everything will help you a lot because when you were speaking comfortably, you did sound very comfortable and confident, which is great. So overall, I will give you a score of seven in the IELTS bands. Thank you. Thank you very much.
