 So those are all the questions, so your test is over and now let's get into the feedback. So for the feedback, all right. So you did really well in your speaking test. I thought you used some good vocabulary, idiomatic vocabulary. And also your grammar was very good when you were speaking. You spoke very confidently as well. So those are some really big pluses. For the first section, I know that there are kind of general questions, but sometimes the answer was a little short, just a little short. So for example, do you like cooking question? It would have been really great if you developed that a bit more. Yeah, it seems like a yes-no question, but it's always really good to develop your answers as much as you can. For myself? Yes, for yourself. Okay. There were a few just idiomatic errors. Like when you were describing about getting up in the morning and eating breakfast, in the middle of 7 a.m. Or in the middle of 6 a.m. Maybe we would say like half past 7 or 7 30, half past 7 30. And also when we were talking about popular fast food restaurants versus traditional restaurants, just test out their fame. It's really, it's a good way to say it, but a better way to say it, they would like to try out some famous or well-known place. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Great. But overall, you did give very long and detailed responses, in particular for part two and part three. And your vocabulary and grammar was good. So I would give you an 8.5 on the other scale. I actually found it. Okay. Thanks. Well done. Thanks. You're welcome.
