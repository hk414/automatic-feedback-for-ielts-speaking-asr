 Alright, so yeah, let's start with the feedback. So I'd estimate your score. I'd estimate around 8.0 for that. Yeah, it was good score. Very fluent, good pronunciation, obviously very clear. The only thing you could do probably to improve your score is try to use a little bit of higher level vocabulary, better expressions. Try to explain yourself in a little bit more detail. Especially in some of the part 1 questions, the answers were a little short, so a bit longer if you can. In part 3 as well, when we say, you know, the questions are more like what kinds of people and what are the benefits when a child is popular at school. So you should keep it like generally speaking rather than your specific story. Grammar like there's not much to say really. During free time, I would say like in my free time or when I have some free time, birthday preposition should be like on my birthday or when it is my birthday either or your old boss, you said he was on his 50s, should be in his 50s. One verb was influenced, so you can say just he influenced Korean people or he had an influence on Korean people. Those are two things. So the rest of it is really good. Obviously you're very comfortable communicating in English. Just for someone like you, someone who's higher level, the main thing is adding in maybe some idioms, some phrasal verbs, like increasing the vocabulary you're using. That's good man. Thanks for coming in. Thank you. Alright, cheers.
