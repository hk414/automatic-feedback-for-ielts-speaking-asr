 We are finished, our questions for part three, and now we're going to move on to the feedback. OK. OK, so now we are going to have some feedback. So the IELTS test has four different sections, which you are graded on. Fluency and coherence, lexical resource, rheumatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation. So your fluency and coherence was really good. You were able to speak fluently about the range of questions asked, and you didn't really hesitate much, which was great. In terms of lexical resource, you did quite well, but there was just a few small mistakes. You said the skill decreased, but you should say something like my ability decreased or my skills got weaker. For grammatical range and accuracy, there was a few small mistakes, things like articles. Sometimes they were omitted, and sometimes they were added in. So, for example, though my friend, we don't need to put that in front of my friend. Things like S is at the end of words. We have car instead of we have cars, or one of my best friends instead of one of my best friends. So just a small few mistakes there. And in terms of pronunciation, it was quite good. There was just a small few things again. So elementary school, so the end of that word kind of got a bit lost. So just a small few things here and there. But overall it was very good. So I think I would put you at a 7.5. Okay.
