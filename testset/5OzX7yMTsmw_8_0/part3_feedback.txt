   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using discourse markers like "so," "like," and "but" to connect ideas. For example, they use "so, I think that's the reason" to transition between points effectively. However, there are noticeable hesitations and repetitions, such as "like a" and "like a" at the start of multiple sentences, which slightly disrupt the natural rhythm. Despite these minor issues, the candidate maintains coherence throughout the responses, making their ideas easy to follow.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using terms like "discipline," "generational wealth," "tangible," and "procrastinate" appropriately. They also show flexibility by paraphrasing ideas, such as explaining that "the rich doesn't come from lucky" instead of "the rich don't come from luck." This variety and precision in word choice support a Band 7.5 score, as the vocabulary is used flexibly and accurately across different topics.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "they are no longer dependent on the location or even the time," which shows good grammatical awareness. However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues ("the rich doesn't come from lucky"), incorrect prepositions ("give themselves in the temptation"), and awkward phrasing ("the way they can just like a screw things up"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and consistent, with good use of intonation and stress patterns that enhance meaning. For example, their emphasis on "poor" and "rich" effectively contrasts the two ideas. The rhythm of their speech is natural, and there are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension. This consistent and intelligible delivery supports a Band 7 score, as the candidate communicates effectively despite occasional grammatical inaccuracies.
