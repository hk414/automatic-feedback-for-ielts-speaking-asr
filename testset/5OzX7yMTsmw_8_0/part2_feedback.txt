   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, maintaining topic relevance throughout the response. They use cohesive devices such as "so," "and," and "first of all" to structure their ideas logically. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., "uh, expensive activity, so actually, that's uh...") which slightly disrupt the natural rhythm. While the candidate manages to develop their points coherently, the pauses and repetition prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using topic-specific terms like "gym session," "muscle mass," "supplements," and "food consummation" effectively. They also attempt to paraphrase with phrases like "it doesn't matter whether I'm a man or a woman" and "it actually takes the discipline first of all." The vocabulary is generally precise and appropriate for the topic, showing flexibility and awareness of style, which supports a strong Lexical Resource score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "it actually takes a lot of supplements and even a discipline and even a food consummation," though some of these are grammatically awkward. There are frequent errors in verb forms ("it actually requires the protein powder and just like a bunch of like supplements") and article usage ("a proper amount of food calories"). While the candidate shows an effort to use varied grammar, the frequency of errors affects clarity and prevents a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. They articulate most words accurately, and their stress patterns are mostly appropriate (e.g., "expensive activity," "muscle mass"). However, there are some mispronunciations, such as "consummation" instead of "consumption," and occasional slurring of words (e.g., "like a bunch of like supplements"). Despite these minor issues, the candidate's pronunciation supports effective communication.
