3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate generally speaks at length without significant pauses, demonstrating a good ability to maintain topic development. For example, when discussing his hometown, he provides a coherent narrative about his childhood, mentioning family members and the peaceful environment. He uses cohesive devices like "although," "however," and "so" effectively to link ideas. However, there are moments of hesitation, such as when he says, "like a... I just... I just determined to like a view like my life as some sort of a challenge," which indicates a slight struggle to formulate complex thoughts on the spot. This is typical of Band 7, where fluency is generally smooth but not effortless.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, including less common terms like "self-improvement," "discipline," and "urban/suburban." He also uses idiomatic expressions such as "a significant moment" and "a milestone," which shows flexibility in word choice. His vocabulary is precise and relevant to the topics discussed, such as "side hustles" and "financial stability." However, there are minor issues with word choice, such as saying "like a... I just determined to like a view like my life as some sort of a challenge," where the repetition of "like" and the awkward phrasing slightly reduce clarity. This level of lexical resource is characteristic of Band 7.5.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as when he says, "I just determined to like a view like my life as some sort of a challenge instead of the uh like some sort of a impasse I supposed to face." While he shows an awareness of complex structures, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues ("I just determined to like a view like my life as some sort of a challenge"), incorrect prepositions ("like a... I just determined to like a view like my life"), and awkward phrasing ("I'm just like a still struggling with it"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score. The candidate's ability to use a range of structures is evident, but accuracy is inconsistent, placing him in the Band 6.5 range.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with a noticeable but not distracting accent. His intonation and rhythm are mostly natural, contributing to the overall fluency. For example, his delivery of "I just determined to like a view like my life as some sort of a challenge" is understandable despite the grammatical issues. However, there are some mispronunciations, such as "like a... I just determined to like a view like my life as some sort of a challenge," where the repetition of "like" and the awkward phrasing affect clarity. The candidate's pronunciation is effective for communication, aligning with Band 7.
