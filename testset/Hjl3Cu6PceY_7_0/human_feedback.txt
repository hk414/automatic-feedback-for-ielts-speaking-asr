 we can move on to the feedback. All right. So as you probably know, the IELTS is scored on four categories. There's fluency, vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. You are a very strong speaker across the board. You did an excellent job on this exam. So we'll take them, just make a few comments on each category. In terms of fluency, you speak naturally, really no pauses other than the natural pause that is needed to find a word or find a phrase. So that's really as strong as it can get. I notice no additional hesitation. Your vocabulary is great. I noticed not just a range of words, but also idioms and uncommon words and native like collocations. You said things like a love and hate relationship, which is a very common natural phrase. Instead of just saying transportation, referred to the transportation system, which is a good advanced way to say that. And then there were really uncommon words, like an inverter bridge to describe how you relax at home. That was great. Hierarchy is another one of these more academic kind of words that are very good to use. And also, I think, referred to yourself as a night owl. Yes. Again, good idiomatic language that reaches into the top isle spans. Moving on, more good things to say. Your grammar is very good. A range of tenses, present, perfect, perfect, continuous, so things like she has been performing, which are very good to mark when things are happening and the relationship. And also good advanced phrases like, I guess you could call it to introduce some uncertainty or to show how you feel about something. You also said, from what I remember, which is a very good way to say that I'm not 100% sure. Exactly. Yeah. To add that nuance. So that was very good. Your pronunciation is also very good. Clear throughout. No issues with single words or stress. And there is a sort of natural rhythm arising from all to your speech. So that was overall excellent. And in terms of the parts, you answered all of the questions in enough detail. The part two answer was about the right amount of time. The only area that maybe for improvement would be part three. And it's not really language. It's more of an approach to the question. I know it's a little bit hard because we just sort of changed topics on. And there's no pause here from questions. But if there were any way to give slightly longer answers, in part three, that would be the only area I can think of to work on. So for example, explaining why people might be popular at work, maybe going on to elaborate with a short reason would be helpful. I felt like I was going off in a rant. I was trying to cut myself off a little bit. It's OK. It's a very good job. And then I think it's somewhat tricky question the way it's phrased. Which one is more important, keeping a good relationship with colleagues or doing well at work? It feels like a strange choice. And I think you struggle as a result of the question. But practicing those, if you really wanted to push forward, you did an excellent job. Thank you. And really, thank you for coming in. It was nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you too. Thank you.
