 feedback time. You don't have to stress too much. Actually, these are mainly positives. You're very fluent. You've got good language skill. You use very good vocabulary. It's not a lot of grammar issues. Like, I really had to try and find mistakes. It was hard for me. There weren't many mistakes that you made. I think the only one that comes to mind is to put an example rather than to give an example. It's not only a mistake that I could really like find that you used incorrectly. I think overall very positive. I would give you a seven. The only things that I could really advise you to improve on is maybe to use less fellow words. Like that kind of thing. If you could just learn to do that less, I think you could easily go up to like 7.5. Maybe even eight. I think maybe a nervousness can play a big part in it as well. I think one more thing was, and again, I'm really like trying to find mistakes here. It's not that you made many. You used instinct. You described people having a day off. It's part of their instinct. It is popped out of nowhere. It's not completely wrong. You could maybe use it just in the context of it's part of our instinct to want leisure time as well. Maybe if you just framed it in that way, it would have been perfectly fine to use. You just said it's human instinct. Like you didn't expand enough on the idea of us wanting that as a need. Otherwise, I think another tip I could maybe give you is just to speak a bit slower. I think if you speak a little bit slower, it gives you time to think about what you're going to say next to, I think when a person is nervous, you tend to speak more quickly. Your mouth is going faster than your brain. Yeah, so I make more mistakes. Yeah, so I think if you could just slow down a little bit, less fuller words, I think you can easily go from like 7 to 7.5. Maybe even eight. If you can just build your confidence a little bit more, but really that was very positive, honestly. Do you have any questions from your side? No, that I can think of right now. Okay, well, I think we're done then in that case. Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.
