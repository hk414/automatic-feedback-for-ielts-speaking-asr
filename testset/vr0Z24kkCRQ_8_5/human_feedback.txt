 So overall, there's a really strong test as you're probably aware of the IELTS is scored on four categories. There's fluency and coherence, pronunciation, vocabulary, and then grammar. In thinking of your test here, the first two categories are very strong, fluency and pronunciation. Really no pauses other than to think of a word and your accent shows the expense of time in the US. It's just natural. Those are really good. You can't really make any improvements there. Evokeveler and grammar are also very good. There were only a few things that might have jumped out where there was an opportunity to either use a more advanced word or you weren't quite sure what that word was. The first class question in part two, where you think you're going to lower the proper one there is lower in upper class. Yes. First or second class. So getting those more advanced words just perfectly attuned in terms of accuracy. There was a point in part two where you used advices, but advices something that we can't count. So if you need to say the plural form of advice would be like lots of advice, but not advices. There was another point, I guess, in part one when you were discussing the population of soul. Oh, it's the density. Yes, that's actually the word. The word there, the really advanced word, that I think would have fit with his density. You know it, but being comfortable using it in this testing format would be really the only thing to work on. And maybe one final note, some of your answers in part three were good. I think the last one in particular was good. Some of them were a little short. That's the, those are hard questions. They're supposed to be hard and you're supposed to think broadly about them. But if you can, giving like a paragraph level answer, where you kind of have a main idea and you elaborate and explain, it's a good way to increase your score slightly. But like I said, this was a really good test. It did very well. I would estimate your score at 8.5 for today. What is it? It's out of nine. It's out of nine. 8.5 is very good. These tiny little things related to mostly vocabulary are sort of the way forward. But anyway, good luck in your studies. And yeah, thanks for coming in. Thank you.
