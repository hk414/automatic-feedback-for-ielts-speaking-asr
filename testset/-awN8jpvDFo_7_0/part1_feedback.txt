3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate generally speaks at length with a good pace and maintains topic relevance throughout the conversation. She uses a variety of cohesive devices such as "and also," "but still," and "because" to link ideas effectively. However, there are noticeable hesitations and fillers like "um" and "like" that interrupt the flow, particularly when she is thinking of words (e.g., "I'm like right now living in a place called..."). While she manages to stay on topic, the pauses and repetition of phrases like "I'm thinking that I could learn from like anybody, anything" suggest some effort in maintaining a smooth, natural delivery, which aligns with a Band 7 performance.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong and varied vocabulary appropriate for the topics discussed. She uses precise terms such as "freelancer," "massive fandom," and "life-giving meaning" to express her ideas effectively. Her ability to paraphrase is evident when she describes her hometown as "a kind of a bad town" and later explains that "the part when we have to study" is boring. This flexibility and range of vocabulary, including topic-specific terms like "idol groups" and "politics," contribute to a Band 7.5 score, showing a good command of language beyond basic expressions.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, such as "I think it's a really meaningful thing for me to do as a living" and "I could learn from like anybody, anything." However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including incorrect verb forms ("I'm like right now living"), missing articles ("a place called Jungnang-gu"), and incorrect prepositions ("connected to the politics"). While she attempts more complex constructions, the errors in basic grammar and sentence structure prevent a higher score, placing her in the Band 6.5 range.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm that reflects natural speech patterns. Her stress and word pronunciation are accurate, such as in "freelancer" and "communication." However, there are some minor issues, like the elongated "um" sounds and occasional mispronunciations (e.g., "Jungnang-gu" may be slightly mispronounced). Despite these small issues, her overall delivery is fluent and intelligible, which supports a Band 7 score.
