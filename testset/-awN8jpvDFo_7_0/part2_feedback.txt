3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, maintaining relevance to the prompt about noisy public transport. They use cohesive devices like "so," "and," and "because" effectively to link ideas, and their narrative structure is clear. However, there are noticeable pauses and self-corrections (e.g., "um" and "like" fillers), and a slight hesitation when describing the friend's phone call ("my friend was making a short call with her boyfriend and her voice got louder and louder because of the crowded people like the loud noises that the people made"). These interruptions, while not disrupting overall coherence, are characteristic of Band 7 rather than the effortless fluency of Band 8 or 9.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using topic-specific terms like "public transportation," "crowded," "loud noises," and "anxiety." They also employ more sophisticated phrases such as "ethics in public transportation" and "made a lot of noise," showing flexibility and an attempt at paraphrase. The vocabulary is generally precise and appropriate for the context, contributing to a clear and expressive response. This level of lexical variety and control aligns with a Band 7.5.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "I think people should be... like need etiquettes in the public transportation" and "that time was when my nearest person made a lot of noise." However, there are noticeable grammatical inaccuracies, including the incorrect phrase "need etiquettes" (should be "etiquette") and the awkward construction "the time when my nearest person made a lot of noise" (should be "closest person"). While the candidate uses some complex sentences effectively, these errors, along with occasional tense inconsistencies, limit the score to Band 6.5.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout the response. They use appropriate stress and intonation, particularly in longer sentences like "I think it depends on the time that you get on the subway." There are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension, and the rhythm of speech is natural. The candidate's delivery is confident and consistent, which supports a Band 7 score.
