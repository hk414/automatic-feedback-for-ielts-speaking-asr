1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate demonstrates good fluency and coherence with a clear range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, though some hesitation and minor grammatical inaccuracies prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0  
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5  
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5  
   - Pronunciation: 7.0  

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using appropriate discourse markers like "because" and "so" to connect ideas. For example, she explains her reasoning for choosing parks as noise-free places by linking the outdoor setting to people's freedom to rest and children's ability to play. However, there are noticeable pauses and self-corrections, such as "uh, I think the most noise-free place that was um like that took my mind was," which slightly disrupts the natural rhythm. These hesitations are typical of Band 7, where fluency is maintained but not effortless.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a good range of vocabulary relevant to the topic, including "playground," "parks," "public transportation," and "anxiety." She also demonstrates flexibility by paraphrasing, such as saying "the place is very accessible in any places" instead of simply "easy to reach." Her use of "I wish that people could be quiet in that place" shows an attempt to express personal opinion with appropriate phrasing. This variety and precision support a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "that place is very accessible in any places because that river is like in the middle of our capital city." However, there are grammatical inaccuracies, including "in any places" (should be "in all places") and "that took my mind was" (awkward phrasing). She also uses "I'm a person who studied about communication" instead of "I studied" or "I am studying," showing some control but with errors that affect clarity. These issues prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. For example, her pitch rises appropriately when asking "And do you think people should be allowed to make noise in all public areas?" This shows awareness of discourse features. However, there are some minor mispronunciations, such as "Han River" (possibly intended as "Hantan River" or similar), and occasional unclear word boundaries, like "I'm a bit feel frustrated." These do not hinder understanding but prevent a Band 8.
