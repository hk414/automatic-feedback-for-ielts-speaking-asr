 All right, so yeah, let's talk about the test and give you some feedback about it. I would estimate your score to be 6.5 today. I think it was a really good test. Strong point is definitely fluency. You have never hesitated, I think the whole test. So I think that was really strong. Fluency was good. When it comes to some with pronunciation, sometimes I don't think we're pronouncing the whole word, we're kind of squeezing it together a little bit. For example, like beginning, I can hear it kind of merge into like two syllables. Or for example, represent. So I know fluency is important, but make sure as well that we try to pronounce everything clearly as much as we can. Yeah, we can practice that. In terms of vocab, you used a lot of good vocab, you used some good phrasal verbs as well. You pair up with your friends, you signed up for a gym, these are strong, and these are good. We go through some grammar errors, and I'll just point out a few to you. When you talked about your city, you said everything in there is for older people. So we shouldn't say in there, we should just say there, everything there. So when you talk about a city, if you use the city name, you can say in, like in Seoul, or in Busan. But when we use the pronoun, we just say everything there. Part one as well, when I was talking about your singing, you were using, could I could learn, or I could represent, or I couldn't represent. So I would say use the present tense there. I can learn this, I can't represent everyone. One time my singing is kind of worse. So when we say worse, we want to compare with something else. So you can say my singing is not good, it's terrible, it's worse than most people. We can say that. In part two, again, fluency was strong. Sometimes you were saying, I will pair up and I will do that. So I heard sometimes future tense plus past tense, right? So if we look at the question, it's all past tense. When you went there, what you did there, how you felt about the place. So let's make sure it's all in the past tense. Some good expressions as well. When I give you one question, you answered with, like it's hard to say, it's a difficult answer. I think that was nice. Good expression. One question in part three, I think there was misunderstanding. I asked, why do people like to watch sports on TV rather than going to stadiums? I think you heard studio, did you? I think that was it. So it was more like, why do people like to watch sports on their TV rather than going to the sports stadium and watching live? So there's a little bit of confusion there, but that's a small thing. At the end, when you talk about athletes, you said it is really worth it. It is really worth it. I think a better expression would be they deserve it. They deserve it. And we want to try and give clear reasons as well. For example, they deserve it because their career is very short and they've trained really hard to get there. So yeah, a few things, but really good test overall. So thank you for coming in. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
