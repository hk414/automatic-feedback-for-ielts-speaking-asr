 That was a nice test. We'll give you some feedback. We'll go through it. I would estimate your score to be, I'd say, 7.0 Yeah, you're very fluent with good pronunciation and most of your answers were very Clear and easy to understand like there is some small grammar errors or phrasing errors that we could improve on I'll just go through a few of them with you, right? We'll talk about them When you're talking about like areas in Seoul you talk about like Mapo-gu or somewhere like that You mentioned the word town. I probably wouldn't say town. I would say like area or neighborhood A town is somewhere that's smaller than a city. It's not inside the city So yeah, I would say like Gangnam is a busy neighborhood or it's a busy area. I think that's better to say When you talked about your gift that I got I think it's a got from my 8th birthday I would say like got for my 8th birthday From you would say like the person I Got it from my parents for my 8th birthday, right? A few prepositions here when you talked about your savings account you said put it at that account It should be in that account. Yeah, when you talk about bank accounts put it in the account, right? When you mentioned maybe like winter also winter is a season so for seasons we must say in Yeah, so for months and seasons and years we should say in so in winter, you know in July in 2024, right Just some word choice here as well when you talked about Cash, you know you talked about what talk or like that you said some places they they get cash only I would say better verbs to use would be like take or accept Yeah, yeah, they like you could say they don't accept card. They don't take card. They only accept cash, right? Okay, part two was good. You spoke for a minute and 20 so the maximum speaking time is Two minutes so if you've got more Details to add I would add to it. I think after your speech I asked you again like the last part like how you felt about it So you could maybe give a little bit more detail there, but that was nice What do we see here when you talked about Taking it to a police station you said a near police station in that case you should say nearby Because nearby can be used as an adjective a nearby police station And also we saw a news make sure news is uncountable Okay, so we saw we saw news you could say we saw a news story You could say it like that What else could we got so yeah for the police station like put it into the police station? I think better term there would be Hand it into so hand it into the police station. Yeah, so like we considered handing it into the police station or just leaving it there Yeah, that was great In part three when you talked about one thing you talked about if you lose air pods or electronic device You said like check it on Google maybe a better word than check would be a track Track it if you use an electronic device you should track it. Yeah Also in part three Make sure that you don't talk about like your personal story, but part three is more like people in general So you'll notice in the part three questions like what kind of things do people often use? Why do some people find lost items so rather than your personal Story you should speak generally yeah, but those those good tests overall really nice. All right. Thank you for coming in Thank you
