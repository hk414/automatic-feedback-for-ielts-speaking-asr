 As you probably know, the IELTS test is scored on four categories. So there's fluency and coherence, there's pronunciation, and then vocabulary and grammar. I think you did a really nice job overall, sort of working in order. The first two categories, fluency and pronunciation, I thought were both very strong. We have a sort of natural rhythm of speaking. And all of the words are pronounced with an easy to understand common standard English pronunciation. So those are both very good. Grammar and vocabulary were also good, but it might be here that a little bit of improvement is possible. Just to point out a few vocabulary things that I heard along the way. In part one, when you were describing the nature sort of landscape in Switzerland, I think you described it as wide. I know what you mean, but there's probably other expressions. Maybe you could describe it as expansive, impressive, imposing, I'm picturing the mountains of Switzerland. But yeah, expansive rather than wide would be the kind of adjective to try there. There was one little mix up around, I think you were looking for the word irrelevant, but I'm not sure it came out quite right. In part two, as you were describing the ice cream, you use some good words like inquisitive is a very good advanced word. A couple words to maybe think about, I think you described the debate about mint chocolate as controversial. Again, I know what you mean, but I'm not sure something like that would be controversial because it's so it's not really important. Something like politics can be controversial because it has a sort of emotional charge ice cream flavors. They might be hotly debated, but it's in a sort of a playful spirit. So I'm not sure it would be described as controversial. And it would probably be possible in that answer to think of some other ways to express the idea that you wanted to try it. You repeated the idea that you wanted to go for it and go for it, which is a very good expression, but trying for more variety to express the idea that you want to try this new flavor. More vocabulary in part three. There's some very good words. It talked about advocating for your position, which is very good and talked about something triggering. So these are good sort of advanced words to be using. And so, you know, mostly good, but always there's always room for improvement. In terms of grammar, mostly pretty good. The use of the past tense in part two. A couple of little slip ups kind of working in reverse order in part three. I think you described something as being more nice. But that's a good opportunity to use the comparative to describe it as nicer, rather than more nice. And in part one, there's maybe a preposition at one point. I mentioned something. I think shopping was a would keep you off negative thoughts. Instead of off and maybe keep you away from or help you avoid negative thoughts. So these are really small things. But at the advanced sort of bands, it's important to try to keep them as accurate as possible. So really good job. And based on all of that, I think your estimated score today would probably be 7.0. But a strong 7.0. And with a little bit of fine tuning on the vocabulary, I think you get even higher. So thanks for coming in. And good luck.
