 So that is everything for the test today. Now let's get into the feedback. Okay. All right. So overall I would say that you did really quite well on this test. Some of the main points where you did well were that you spoke clearly and coherently at length and you answered each question in detail. So that is really great. That is huge. Sometimes it can be difficult to answer these questions in detail when you're hearing them for the first time. But you answered them very well and very naturally, generally speaking. Your word choice was generally quite appropriate and natural. You also included some idiomatic expressions. Like for example, you said your brother was playing tricks on you. And that yeah, so you did include some like idiomatic language and things like that. So that was really good. There were a few minor issues, however, with like conjugation, for example. So when asked about the difference between the roles of teachers and parents in education, you said parents has the responsibility. But this wasn't really an error throughout your exam. It was just some kind of isolated incidents like that. Additionally, there were some occasional unnatural word choice. Overall, your word choices were quite natural, but some things like studying for my major. So in English, we don't tend to express it like that. We would say studying for university. Oh, I see. Our studying for my classes. Something like that. And you talked about the you went to New Zealand for English learning process. It's okay. I know the second part of the test can be quite difficult. So it's totally fine. But just a smoother way to express that would be I went to New Zealand to learn English. Mm-hmm. I see. But those mistakes were very few and far between, to be honest. So overall, I would give you a score of 8.5 because you did answer everything in detail at length and generally correctly, but there were a few errors here and there. I see. Thank you for your feedback. You're welcome.
