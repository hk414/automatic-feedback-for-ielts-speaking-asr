 Great. So now that it's for your test, so let's get into the feedback section. All right, so let's get into the feedback on your IELTS test. All right, so there's a lot of things that you did really, really well during your test. For example, your pronunciation and accent were really excellent. I couldn't really pick up on any like awkward pronunciations or anything like that. Everything sounded very fluent and you were very well spoken. All right, you were also very confident, which is a great thing because you didn't really have any language-related hesitation, which is great. You used some more idiomatic expressions. So for example, you talked about chitchatting with your friends while having snacks. Then when talking about the pros and cons of family businesses, you were like, oh, well, on the other hands. So those expressions sounded really natural and they really added to the richness of your responses. So great job there. Thank you. Yeah, in general, I would say you did really well. You also used some business-specific vocabulary, so about product distribution, different departments, revenue and maximizing efficiency. That was also really, really good. Where you could improve, I think your part too, you would have benefited from longer and more detailed response. Yeah, the response you gave was very good. However, it was only one minute and three seconds long, and you do have two whole minutes to speak, so it would be better if you could utilize that time a bit more next time, okay? Also, there were some occasional grammatical and lexical inaccuracies. Not too many, but for example, when you were describing your mother, you said, my mother, which is the executive? So typically, we would say, like, my mother, who is an executive? So we would change the article and the which and that. Yeah. And also, yeah, this isn't really fully a mistake, but when you were talking about what snacks you liked to eat, instead of like, we usually say, oh, usually I would prefer. You said, will. Oh, okay. Yeah, I see. So it's not really wrong, but usually we would say would. Yeah. So just a few things there, but overall, I would give you an eight on your aisle's test. All right. Thank you.
