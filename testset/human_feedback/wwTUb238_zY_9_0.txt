 Now let's get on to the feedback section of your test. Sure. Okay. So, you did a lot of things really, really well. Okay. I found you to be very eloquent and well-spoken. Thank you. You're very welcome. And your answers were well-structured. So, you kind of went with the main point or topic sentence and then you got into your like deeper thoughts or explanations and examples. And you usually concluded your answer pretty smoothly. All right. Yeah. Your pronunciation and your accent is also native level, to be honest. Oh, yes. I've heard that a lot. Yes. It's indistinguishable actually from a native speaker. So, that was really great. You also used a lot of expressions and idioms. So when I say expressions, I mean like things to make your speech sound more smooth. So you often said like, I would say or on the other hand things like that to kind of make your speech flow more and to add to you know, understandability and coherence. So that was wonderful. You also used a lot of like higher level vocabularies. So you talked about your writing being legible. And you also talked about a person who helps others having an impartial mind. Things like that. Yeah. There were one or two little tiny slips. Like favoritism to situations. So should have been favoritism in situations. Right. But honestly, like native speakers also make those little mistakes from time to time. And they were very negligible. Okay. So overall, I would say you did an excellent job. And I would give you a score of nine on the I'll speaking test. Thank you very much. You're very welcome.
