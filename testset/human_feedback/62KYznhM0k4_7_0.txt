 Yeah, start with the feedback. I'd say your score would be estimated 7.0. I'd say it's a good score. Very fluent with good pronunciation and strong grammar throughout. Obviously, there are some errors that we can go through and we can look at to improve. If we look at vocabulary, first of all, you use a lot of good phrases. When you're talking about colors, you're saying, black, it goes with everything, white, it goes with everything. Yeah, some nice expressions in terms of errors. So when you talked about your major, what you're studying, and your studying graphic design besides, you could say that, but maybe on the side would be better. I'm studying graphic design on the side. It means it's not your main focus. It's kind of extra. So you could say that. Just be careful with plural here. We said, my dad gave me advices. Make sure it's singular. Always advice. So always advice. You would say some advice. Some advice. Yeah. Adventure lover. Right, I think a better word there would be adventurous. And adventurous. Yeah, like I'm an adventurous person. Adventure lover is not really a common collocation. People say, like, thrill-seeker. That would be a common one or an adventurous person. Yeah. One thing as well with introvert. So introvert is the noun. An introverted is the adjective. So when you say you're talking about people, you'd say, I'm an introverted person. Or I'm an introvert. Yeah, either one. Yeah, so that's cool there. That's good. Few phrasing, let's just go through two or three of them. You talk about Busan surrounded by ocean. You know, surrounded is kind of like the whole way around. But I would say Busan is on the coast. On the coast. I would say it's on the coast. Also, you could say it's a coastal city, either on. But like, surrounded means with more like an island. It's surrounded. I think we're like Jeju surrounded by the ocean. Okay, one word we use as well as suitable. Sorry, suitable for my room. Instead of suitable, I would say, suit is a better word there. Suit. Suitable is more for like the situation. Like if you talk about like a horror movie, it's not suitable for kids. Yeah. Or like if you wanna go hiking, if you're wearing like very thin clothing, it's not suitable for hiking. Yeah. But when you talk about like your style or like a room like it suits the atmosphere, it suits the room. Yeah. Same with your clothing like, oh, it suits you. Like blue suits you. Oh, okay. A couple of times maybe like even, instead of one time, even though I dislike it, and nothing it was in the last question. So it should be here, even if I dislike it. Oh. What's the difference? Even if. Even if, even if it's more like it's a possibility. Even though, it's like statement. Yeah. So if you say, I tried skiing last winter, even though I dislike it, because it's more definite. Okay. But even if it's more like possibility. Oh, I see. So when you're making like a general statement, even if I dislike it. Even if. Okay. Okay. So if we got, just in part three, just be careful with not giving too much personal statements. You said like, I got advice from my dad. I wanna be a CEO. So in part three, it's more about like people in general. So just try and keep your answers more generally speaking, rather than about you. You can give it as an example, but for example, the last one, do the young people like talking with older people? You're like, I'm a younger person. Or what advice will my dad give me? It's more general in part three. Okay. Well, it was a really good test overall. You spoke really comfortably. Thanks for coming in. Thank you. All right. I just finished looking at the
