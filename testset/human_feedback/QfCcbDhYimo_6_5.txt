 So, you did a lot of really great things during your test. So, you spoke very clearly. Your accent was very good. Pronunciation was generally good. There were just a few things. Like, the word zoo. I know it can be hard to enunciate the zoo always. But you actually did correct yourself. So that was really good. And also, when you were talking about dogs, you said their hair is flurry, but usually we would say fluffy. So just some small little pronunciation, things like that. But you also used a good range of vocabulary. So for example, when you were talking about animals being kept in city zoos, you said, oh, it's kind of like a paradox. Because they should be in the wild. Because they're wild animals and then we keep them in the zoo. So it doesn't make much sense, right? So I thought that was really good. Yeah, so in general, you did really well. And you also used some idiomatic expressions, such as like, lean on, like people lean on their animals for support. They get support from their animals. Things like that, which was really great. There were a few little expression issues though. So you would say something like the zoos keepers. The zoos keepers. Yeah, instead of like the zoo keepers, just some very, very little details. And also, when you were talking about the behavior of dogs, you said liberation. But we should say they act in a very liberated way. Right, right, right, right. Yeah, or we could also say with a different expression, like they behave very freely. Yeah, okay. But overall, you did very well. And I think I would give you a 6.5 on the Isle scale. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. You're very welcome. And you did a really great job. Oh, thank you. I'm happy for your visit, actually. Well, that's great. Yeah, thank you so much. It was lovely to meet you today. Oh, you too. Thank you.
