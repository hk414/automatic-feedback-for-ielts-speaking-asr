 I'm gonna stop it here. I've heard everything I needed to. Okay, so we judge you based on four different criteria. It would be fluency, vocab, grammar, and pronunciation. So long story short, I would give you 8.5. 8.5 band score. The reason for that is your pronunciation. You sound like a guapo. You sound like you've lived abroad for a very long time. So your accent, everything is super clear, super easy to follow really well. Grammar wise, I tried to find mistakes, but really there wasn't much. Oh, there's not a lot I can tell you. Like there's here and there, there's maybe something if I had to re-watch the video three times, I might catch something else, but the things that you say in the mistakes that you make are like kind of native speaker mistakes. So that sounds very natural as well, like a structure thing here or there. So that's good. You can tell your students, this is an example of how to be one day. Your vocab is excellent and your fluency has absolutely no issues either. So the reason why I'm giving you 8.5.9 is probably just because you didn't come here prepared. I think if you prepared, if you spend one or two weeks just going over the structure that we want you to talk in for IELTS, I think you could easily get a 9. So considering you came in off the street, the way you spoke, that's an 8.5. That was really well done and I think anybody watching this is a great example of how to speak I think the pacing of your answers is really good. I think a lot of students in the beginning, they don't know how to speak quickly or slowly, they're kind of struggling with that pacing thing, especially in the IELTS speaking test. I think if you speak too quickly, you kind of fall over your own feet. So I always tell them to slow down a bit and I think your way of speaking is a really excellent example. Calm, cool, no rushing. I think it's a good thing for students to see if they're aiming to get a high school. So yeah, thank you so much. Oh, thank you for the opportunity. It's a pleasure.
