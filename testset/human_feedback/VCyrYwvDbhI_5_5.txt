 Right, good test. Thanks for coming in. Yeah. So what's in your score is probably about, I'd say go to 5.5 today. All right, 5.5. You spoke well, you answered all the questions. Fluency was quite strong. View grammarers just keep coming up throughout. That's what's probably bringing you down a little bit. Okay. Yeah, so I think that was a good time. We'll just pick out a few grammar and phrasing errors. I'm just going to tell you about it. All right. Let's start with vocabulary, right? Vocabulary. So this kind of links in with vocabulary and pronunciation. You said, first you said noréban and then you said karaoke. Yeah, karaoke. English pronunciation, karaoke. Ah, karaoke. You said hop. Ah, pop. Pub. Ah, I miss it. Ah, I miss it. Yeah, no worries, no worries. Because in English hop sounds like hop. Ah, ah. Pub, bar is fine. Yeah, karaoke, pub. Yeah, you all said gift corn. San kungo gift corn. Mobile. I'd say mobile gift coupon. Ah, that's it. Yeah, mobile gift coupons are popular these days. What's your favorite mobile gift coupon? My favorite one is the convenience store one. Ah, yeah, very useful. Yeah, I like the convenience store stuff. Ramen, kimbap. Perfect. Who doesn't? Yeah, these three words, let's get them right. You said as well, when you talked about your home, you said it's for residents. You could use the word residential. Ah, residential. So it's a residential area with lots of apartments. Yeah, when you were talking about basketball, what's it called? The place where people play basketball. Court. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've tried to say that I regret so much. Ah, hey, yeah. It's all good. No worries, no worries. Yeah, so you can see basketball, court, basketball court. Pronunciation. One time you said four months, should be four months. Four months. Four months. And you said four months, never, never any. There's a little bit of pronunciation sometimes with TH, right? So when I hear things, things sounds like things a little bit. Yeah, so just be careful with the TH and the S. I'm sorry, my tongue is flipped. Ah, hey, no worries, no worries, it's normal, it's normal. Just make sure with TH, your tongue goes between your teeth when you're pronouncing. Okay, yeah, you can look up some pronunciation techniques on. It's a grammar, right? Few grammar things as well. Articles. The, sometimes you were saying center of the soul, the Korea, for a name, you never have the article, you know that. Yeah, center of soul in Korea. You also said one time my apartment is at the hill. So it should be on a hill. On a hill. Because there are so many hills. And also you can't say the hill, it's on a hill. Yeah. So you said, I studied just one year, I studied four just one year. Any length of time, you got to say four in your preposition. I studied four an hour, four one year. Okay, careful with the question as well, right? In part one, I said describe your apartment. You didn't describe your apartment, you described the area, right? So the apartment is like the, you should be saying like it's got three bedrooms and living room, it's quite spacious and something like that. So just be careful exactly with the wording of the sentence. Another preposition, you said, I'm talented, Judo, preposition, I'm talented at, I'm good at, I'm terrible at. Okay, always at when you talk about your skill level of an activity. Another one, right, is a very common one. I ask a question and students say it depends on people, right? It should be, it depends on the person. It should be the plus singular. Depends on the person. Like do you like to go to the park? Well, it depends on the season. You know, in summer, I really don't like it, it's too humid, it's too hot. So always, it depends on the, yep. Just be careful with the wording of questions as well, right? One question I ask you, I said, should parents force their children to do sports if they don't want to? You said, no, they don't need to, right? So question, if the question is should they, your answer? They should not, they shouldn't. You know, you know this, right? I know you in class, I think in class you speak a little bit better. But in front of the camera, it's different. But yeah, I'll go over the whole thing with you later, okay? But yeah, thanks for coming in. All right, I'll do it. Cheers.
