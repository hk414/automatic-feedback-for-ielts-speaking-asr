 thinking your score would probably be about a 5.5. Up until part three questions, some of them were answered a little bit incorrectly. Okay, so it wasn't on the right topic. So that could possibly bring you down to five today. But I thought part one and part two were quite comfortable. Yeah. Obviously there are some issues we need to talk about. So I'm just gonna point out a few things that maybe you can improve on. Like one thing I'm sure you know yourself, there's some pronunciation issues. Yeah, you know yourself. The first topic was reading. Yeah, it's different. There was a few occasions where I was hearing leading, reading, it wasn't quite clear. Okay, pronunciation. So the OR and the EL, like reading or really things like that. So pronunciation issues to improve it. It's not easy, but it's just, you gotta practice it. You gotta keep going. Pay attention to like the tongue movement and the position of everything. It loads the guides online that you can practice with. So let's try and practice that. Sometimes there was a little bit with F and P as well. Focus on things like that. Yeah. And around food I was hearing pizza. Should be pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Yeah, yeah. So I know it's the same word, but let's think about the English pronunciation as well when we're doing it. All right. Um, yeah, right. Q, there's grammar errors as well. Grammar was a little bit messy sometimes. You know, your fluency was quite good and like you answered all the questions clearly. Like our communication was good, but there's just some errors that are kind of popping up. Oh, you know, like small things like articles. So I heard I'm student now. Just make sure we pronounce it clearly. I'm a student now. I'm a student now. I prepare to study abroad. So I would be more a present continuous sentence. I'm preparing to study abroad. Yes. Mm-hmm. Ah, this is like a prepositions. You said I want to go in UK. In go UK? So go after go, you have to say two. I want to go to the UK. Yeah. But if you're saying study, I want to study in the UK. I want to study in the UK. I want to go to the UK. Oh, yeah. It's like that. My parents disturbed to me. Just disturbed me. Disurbed me. Disturbed me? No preposition there. In home. At home. At home. You know yourself. Yeah, right. What else have we got? Yeah. Small things. Right, one one expression you use over the moon. You use it a couple of times in part three. Or sorry in part two over the moon. Two times, I think. Yeah. Obviously, repetition is not good of the exact same content. And just this expression, over the moon. What does it mean over the moon? It's really good. Really good. Yeah. But it's more of like a longer term thing, I would say. Eating a nice meal, I wouldn't say over the moon for that. Eating a nice meal, yeah, you're happy. It's more of a short term. Over the moon is very extreme levels of happiness. You know, like if you pass the IELTS test over the moon, got into my dream university over the moon. So I probably wouldn't use it in that case. But like good, good effort for trying to use it. Yeah. Yeah. Some vocabulary, some vocabulary. You said the bibimbap was really big size. You could use the word portion. Portion. Yeah. They served really big portions. Portion is the food size, the amount. And you said, did you say unconvenient? In convenience. In convenience. Maybe I must have heard you. I don't know. Eating outside and eating out, what's the difference? Eating outside does industry, around the handwriting. Yes, yes. And eat out does the quote, visit last round. Yeah, we're going to visit a restaurant. Yeah, so eating out is a better one to talk about that. In part three, right, the first question I asked you was, where do people in your country usually eat? You started off with there are many food in Korea, right? Santhus is like this. We don't need to include them. I know it is a test, but natural answer is better. Where do people usually eat? So for this question, I want you to say, people eat in restaurants, fast food restaurants, convenience stores, at home. So the question was, where you kind of went into the type of food you were saying about pork and beef. So that question wasn't quite answered as we would like it. Yeah. OK, and I asked you about older people and younger people. What do they eat? You said older people have company dinner. I'd say keep the focus on the food. Maybe like older people eat more traditional food. And younger people like, so you said pasta or Italian food. Maybe say younger people are more, you could say, adventurous. They like to try foreign food. They like to try exotic cuisine. Maybe this could be better than that. Yeah. One time he said the most problem, right? A lot of the questions in part three will ask you the problem or advantages or disadvantages. So we can say the most problem. We'd have to say the biggest problem, the main problem, the main advantage. So yeah, apart from that. So if you tidy up the grammar a little bit, you're getting up there, of course. Because as I said, your communication was very clear. It was really good. Yeah. So let's tidy up the grammar a little bit. And let's look at our pronunciation. I'll give you this. You can look at it yourself. We can talk in more detail afterwards. Oh, yeah. OK, we could job. Nice test. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
