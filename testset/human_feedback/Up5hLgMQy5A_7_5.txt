 start with the feedback part now. So I would estimate your score to be 7.5. I think it was a really good test. Your pronunciation and grammar are very clear. If I was to look at some tiny errors there, just a little bit with articles when you were talking about your home, you were like, I live in apartment. Make sure you include the article, I live in an apartment. And when we talk about clauses here, ah yeah, that's the room that I feel most comfortable. You should say that's the room where, if it's an action afterwards, that's the room where I did my exercise, that's the room where I felt comfortable. In part two, when you were talking about the test, so you said there were other people who also prepared. You should probably use the past continuous there. There were other people who were also preparing for the test. So you made a study group together. One small thing with prepositions, right? I think in part three, you said make customers to think about the product. So just when we use the verb make, we do not use the preposition there. So like make customers think about the product. Yeah, it's an exception there. Yeah, in terms of vocabulary, it was pretty strong the whole way. Maybe a couple more we could use when you talked about celebrities, they promote products. You could say that. Another word you could use is endorse. So for example, like Cristiano Ronaldo endorses Nike. So he gives it his kind of approval. And you said some people were snobbish. Maybe a better word there would be a headstrong. So some people are quite headstrong. They do not like listening to others opinions. But yeah, it was really good test. So thanks for coming in. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you.
