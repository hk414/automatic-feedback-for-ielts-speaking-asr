 come to the end. So I think you did a really nice job there. So now we can go into some of the things to work on. And remember, the IELTS is scored on four categories. So there's fluency and coherence. There's pronunciation. Then there's vocabulary and grammar. In terms of both fluency and pronunciation, you really have no problems. You speak with only natural pauses occasionally, as you're looking for a word. And your pronunciation of single words is very good. And your sentences have a rhythm. So both of those categories are really good. In terms of vocabulary and grammar, it's also really good. I was writing down a lot, but there's nothing to worry about. But those would be the two areas to, if you wanted to, move up at all. And we can take a look at a couple of things to think about. There is not one single error. Because you did really well in the test, it's a little small thing here and a small thing there. One part in part one, when you were talking about your studying, you switched a little bit back and forth between the present and the past tense. It was mostly in the past tense and then a few verbs. There was a few, there was an is. But it's important in those questions about the past to keep all of your verbs in the past tense. So keep on that. Keep in mind of that. There was small things about subject verb agreement to, I think at one point you said it doesn't depends on. But we want to remember that it depends. It depends. And really minor things around word order, as you were talking about your hometown, you mentioned that it was very popular with cherry blossoms. We'd actually want to reverse those too. We want to say that cherry blossoms are really popular. Oh, is here. Yeah, yeah. So just minor things. And similar things in part two and part three. The other point might be developing your answers just a little bit more. As you get into those higher IELTS bands, you want to give slightly longer answers. Part two was a good answer, but I could tell that after you got past a minute you started to run out of things to say. The only thing to do to hit the two minutes is to just practice over and over again. To give more details. To give just a little bit more detail. But it was a really well structured answer. You started with describing who the person was and then got more detailed. So I could follow along. And again, with good pronunciation and good fluency, it was good. Within that part two answer, there were a couple of times where I think you were looking for an adjective. Yeah, I know so much. Yeah, at that higher end of vocabulary, the thing to work on is just expanding the range of adjectives that you can call to mind in a test situation. But overall, I thought it was a really good test. Part three was also good answers that could have been slightly more developed, but overall really nice. And these grammar and vocabulary points are very small. So thank you. Well done. And thank you for coming into today. Thank you. I'll see you next time. Nice to meet you too.
