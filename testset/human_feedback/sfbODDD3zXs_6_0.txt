 Okay score wise I would say you're between a 5.5 and a 6. Yeah. So personally I would give you a 6. I think you. I think there are a few things that I'll quickly go over with you. Places where you could improve perhaps to get an even higher score. I see. Thank you. In general your grammar is pretty good. You don't make too many grammar mistakes so that's definitely a positive thing. Here and there there's a few issues with articles and such. For example you would say surrendered by where we would rather say Korea surrendered to Japan. It's small things like that. Sometimes you forget to say a like four man or we could rather say four a man when you designed a handbook. Yeah. You made it or you designed one for a man. Yeah. Or you can say raid with a black cat. They're small issues but if you could improve on those little things you could get maybe a 6.5. I see. There was one question that you misunderstood slightly. It was the question about an unforgettable scenery. So the context of this question is more referring to like a landscape, a natural place. For example if you've been to like Jeju and you went to the top of Halasan Mountain and you remember the view from there. I think the question is more asking about an actual scene that you saw. I understand the dream was something unforgettable that there is a relation but I don't think it's exactly what the question is asking of you. So that might pull your score down a little bit depending on how strict the examiner wants to be. Another thing that could potentially count against you is your pronunciation. My pronunciation matters. It does matter in the IELTS test. There were here or there a few cases where I had to listen very carefully to what word you meant. For example when you said, Shilim is very grey or grey. Grey? Yeah, grey. That's why you weren't. Yeah, like somebody who's maybe not that familiar with strong accents might not know exactly what you mean by that. Like I could pick up your talking about it's a grey city or it's a grey place. There's not a lot of color but somebody who hears you say like grey see they're not going to get that. They might struggle with a word like that. You also use the word boast. Yeah. The way you pronounced it somebody might not get it the first time. But I could understand what you meant. And that's also funny enough even though your pronunciation was a negative. That was a very good piece of vocab to use. You use a lot of good words, a lot of good vocabulary, a bit higher level vocabulary. So that actually counts in your favour. So if you can work on a few little grammar errors and your pronunciation you can actually raise your score by quite a fair bit. Yeah, another thing. Your sentences are more on the basic side. But I think in part three you started to use more complex sentences to explain your points. So I think that's something that you can maybe improve on a little bit. But you're showing like a good level at the moment. I think you have a strong base to further improve from. Are there any questions that you may be have? Yeah. So go for it. No more questions to ask you. Okay, no questions. So just to summarise, if you can fix up a few grammar issues like articles and such, pronunciation can be improved a little bit. I think those would be the main things for you to focus on. I think everything else is a nice and solid base for you to work from. So only big tips that I can give you is maybe to try and have conversation in English. It's conversation in English? Yeah. Like that is a huge help in terms of basically just improving all of your skills. But otherwise, yeah, decent job. Well done. Thank you. Thank you so much.
