 Okay, so we'll finish up there very nice Okay So yeah, let's talk about your test and give you some feedback I would estimate your score to be 7.0. I think you spoke really well Refluently with good pronunciation. Those are the positive things nice I would say in part one try to give a couple of reasons for your answer Some of your answers were just a little bit on the short side, you know So obviously you can speak English very well So trying to give some reasons if you can in part one Part two you spoke for one minute and fifteen which which is okay It's a little on the short side the maximum is two minutes So I would say in the real exam try to keep speaking if you can, you know The examiner will stop you at two minutes anyway Yeah, and then part three we went through it nicely. I think there was one question in part three There was a bit of a misunderstanding, right? The first question what kind of places should be noise free Noise free means like there should be no noise Yeah Like this is a small free zone or alcohol free zone or where you cannot do that. Oh Yeah, I was a bit like I got a misunderstanding because I thought that word was like kids free So yeah, that's the same thing right no kids don't Okay, that's a very common thing in our country Anyway, that's all good. So you answered the rest of them very well. So yeah, that was just that Yeah, there's a few grammars that I'll just point out to you nothing too major Maybe one time I asked about your opinion about childhood and adulthood you said like I'll guess that neither Neither of them are boring instead of I'll guess I think it's better to say like I would say I would say or in my opinion or I believe you know instead of guessing There was one time when you're talking about Time that was very you said that time is very bored. So make sure it's ING in that situation Like maybe high school is boring like students feel bored Yeah, so I think you know yourself anyway, but ED is your feeling or a person's feeling and ING is Describing the situation so that time is really boring for them One thing about countable uncountable is that news instead of news are true the news is true Yeah, you could say news stories there. So those news stories are true But if you're just saying news in general it should be is Okay, we're going that yeah, and part two When you're using the word crowded you're saying like crowded people you'd have to say crowded place Crouted place or crowded with people with people What else do we have other one is about public transportation Instead of saying in the public transportation you should say on Mm-hmm on the subway on a bus, you know, so when people are on public transportation, they should be quiet Okay, because they have to share I think you said share their places to each other It should be share with each other That to share that area you could also say like it's a common area A common area meaning a shared area Yeah, pronunciation was great. There was a couple of words there. Maybe politics politics I think it was the word stress. So yeah politics and little bit one Library so make sure you're pronouncing that one as well. Yeah, but the rest of the pronunciation and fluency were great So yeah, that was a good test. Thank you for coming in. Oh, thank you You
