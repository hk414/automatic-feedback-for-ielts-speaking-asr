 feedback. I think that was a really good test. I would estimate the score to be 8.5 today, really clear the whole way. One thing I would say in part two, try to speak a little bit longer. Your speech was like about a minute or a little bit less than a minute. So in part two, it should be from one to two minutes long. So try and get into a little bit more detail if you can. Right? Not the only thing. Part one, questions. Yeah, just make sure and always give a reason for your answer. And I know science is not really your thing, but in the real exam, you can say that. That's fine. You can say I don't really like science, but just the examiner will continue giving you science questions. So don't be surprised if you say I don't like science and they come back and keep asking you. That's normal. But just always explain, give reasons why. Yeah, reasons why I'm part one. In terms of grammar, errors very few, right? Maybe one time you said about your prom dress, I had to ship it early. Instead of ship it, I'd say get it shipped. Using the passive voice, I had to get it shipped early because the company or the one shipping it. You said as well in part three in an offline shopping mall. I would say like just in a shopping mall. I don't think you need to use the word offline. Yeah. So I'd say usually we say online or in store. Yeah, with either one. But yeah, fluency, pronunciation is all really good. So that was a really nice test. Thank you for coming in. Yeah, thank you.
