 All right, so that's everything for your speaking test. Let's get into the feedback. Okay, so in part one, you actually developed upon your answers quite well, like you would give your like point and then you would explain a bit. So that was really good. That was something that I really liked about your speaking tests, so good job there. Also, you answered all of the questions you were asked appropriately, so that's really good. Okay, so you gave appropriate answers to all of your questions, which shows that you comprehended the questions well and you were able to reply. So that was really, really good. I think that on the other side, there were a few pronunciation errors. So for example, with the word literature, yeah, I noted for example, and also sometimes the vocabulary choice was not quite appropriate. So you said your schedule is like strict, which doesn't make sense, but usually we would use strict to describe like a person. Like a person can be strict or maybe like your school has strict rules, but the schedule we usually describe it as being, you know, tight or busy. Okay, and also at times there was some hesitation. And also sometimes you would use like the incorrect part of speech. So instead of saying like, I am an extrovert dead person, which is like the descriptive word, you would say like, oh, I'm an extrovert person. So like extrovert is a noun and person is also a noun. So instead of using two nouns, we should use an adjective and a noun. Okay, so extrovert dead person. Also at times you dropped your articles. So like the and a and sometimes you dropped those throughout the test, which it's quite a common error and with practice and time, it will improve. But yeah, and also I found that sometimes like the connecting words like you said you like to connect new people instead of connect with new people. But I think maybe it's your first time taking the aisles test, right? So you must be a little nervous. So yeah, overall I would give you a score of five out of nine on the aisles test. Okay.
