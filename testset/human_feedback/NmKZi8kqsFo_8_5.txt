 Right, let's start with some feedback. So really good test. I would estimate score to be 8.5. Run that. Some small errors, I'll just point out to you. OK, small errors. One was I do volunteer works. It should be singular, volunteer work, or volunteer activities. We can say this. I would definitely want to get an iPad. So I would just delete the modal verb here. So I would definitely change that. I definitely want to get an iPad. And just in part one, right? So answers were great, really clear. Just make sure you explain reasons why. So sometimes I ask you do you like using social media or whatever. Just make sure, explain with clear reasons why you like it. One time you said, why not give it a try? It's a good expression, nice expression. But I think I would explain reasons why it would be fun to do this. I think the question was, do you want to work in social media in the future? So maybe you could explain, yeah, I like using it. I like communicating with other people. Maybe something like that. The part two question, right? Just the question was, describe a time when you received money as a gift. So focus on more like one time. And so in the real exam, they want you to specifically describe one situation. I think you were floating between some present tense, some past tense. So we want to make it more specific in part two. But yeah, part three, it wasn't really much. It was all answered really well in part three, actually. You said coins and cash, they're inconvenient to bring around. I would say carry around is a better expression, carry around. And when you talked about the kids in China, they're cutting. You said they cut off the people. I think the better phrase of herb there is cut out. So they cut out the people. Yeah, yeah, I saw that too, actually. All right, so yeah, really good test. Thanks for coming in. Cheers.
