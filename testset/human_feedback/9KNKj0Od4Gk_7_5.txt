 Okay, very good. So now let's get into the feedback section. Okay. All right, so you did some things well in your IELTS speaking test. So I think that you answered every question appropriately. And yeah, you included an appropriate amount of information and you did go into some small amount of detail. Yeah, you used vocabulary appropriately in general too, which was really good. And I also really liked your accent and pronunciation. Thank you. And you sounded relatively smooth and confident when you were speaking for the most part. Some points which could be improved upon. I did notice some instances of hesitation and maybe even backing out of your answer from time to time. Like it was like you started to speak and then you kind of stopped yourself. Or I could see there was somewhere that some further detail that you wanted to include, but you stopped yourself. Maybe it was nerfs or. I was worried about like overing the time that I could answer like the limited time. Okay, the only part which has a time limit is part two actually. Oh, oh. Yes, yes. So you shouldn't have worried, but you know, the IELTS speaking test is a little bit different than other speaking tests in that way. And since it's your first time, that's really understandable. And I think for next time, if you continue speaking, it will be of a benefit to you. Okay. Okay. It's nice. Okay. Sometimes the word choice wasn't always appropriate or some certain words were dropped. So just some examples that I noted was that you were following your parents. We should say like following in my parents footsteps. The idiom. When we say following my parents, it literally means following them. Yes. Literally walking after them. But it's okay. It's actually quite a common error. So don't worry too much about it. Just know the idiom is following in my parents. It's the steps. Yes. Yes. And surfing matches, we say surfing competitions. Oh, competition. Oh, I couldn't come up with a word. And I was like, should I say gain or matches? Yeah, it's okay. It's a very specific vocabulary actually. So for surfing, we would say surfing competitions or even a surfing meet. Meet. Meet. So to meet and to compete, matches are more for like usually team sports, but also for tennis. I'm not sure exactly why. But yeah, usually the sports on a court or a field team sport, we call them matches. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, but overall, I think you did well. There are definitely some points to improve upon. For part two, it was a little on the short side. I really liked how you talked about your friends and you gave a lot of detail about him. I also really thought it was great how you explained your thought process behind talking about your friend, right? Yes. So it was really nice to be able to see like how you decided on your topic. However, it would have been really, really great to get a little bit more detail about your friend. He sounded like a very interesting person. And I'm sure there were a lot of interesting stories. Okay, but you'll know that for next time. Okay. All right. So overall, I will give you a 6.5 out of nine on the IELTS speaking test.
