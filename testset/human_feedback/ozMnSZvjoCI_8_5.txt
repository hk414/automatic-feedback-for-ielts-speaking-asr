 Alright, okay, so yeah, let's start with the feedback. Yeah, so again, absolutely perfect, like fluency, pronunciation, like really nice, and wide range of vocabulary and grammar structures, right? So it was a great test. There is like small things, obviously, we can just talk about. At the beginning, when you said your leave of absence, I mean, in leave of absence, should be, I'm on a leave of absence these days from your university or whatever. Yeah, small prepositions, right? Other prepositions, you said you had to go to this place until 10 a.m. So it should be like, you know, come here, like buy 10 a.m. Yeah, buy is more like the limit, you know, the time limit. You can accompany the boss might say, can you finish that by Friday? Yeah, I usually go to bed by midnight every night, yeah. Okay, one thing you said, like, if I'm meeting with my family, right? So I would put these three here, so meet, meet with, meet up with, right? The word meet with sounds a bit more official, to be honest, right? Meet with. Like, for example, you would say the president of Korea will meet with the president of France next week. Yeah, so it's more like an official meeting or like I have to meet with the director of the company next week. But the other ones are more casual, yeah. Yeah, when alarm, you said, like, I put an alarm, the verb there, set, yeah, set an alarm every morning, yeah. And when you talked about your friend, you said, like, I knew that person for a long time and you should probably use present, perfect tense there. So, yeah, I've known, yeah, yeah, I've known that person for a long time, yeah, until now. One thing is with the president, perfect, continuous. You said, I've started learning English since when I was, blah, blah. So, for example, since and when cannot go together, right? So, for example, you can say, I started, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-when. So I started learning English when I was three years old, yeah. Or like, I've been studying English since, yeah. So yeah, I just, when would go with your past simple and since would go with your present, perfect, continuous. Yeah, so it's a common one I hear of it. What we were saying, whether they're catching up, I think you want to say they're keeping up, right, keeping up with the lesson, yeah. Keeping up with the lesson, following the lesson, yeah. And just in part three, right? So part three is supposed to be about generally speaking. You were relating some of it back to your personal moment. Some is okay, but I would just recommend for like students who are doing the IELTS test in part three, try and keep it more general. Yeah, try and keep it more general, yeah. But yeah, that was a great test, so thank you for your time. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
