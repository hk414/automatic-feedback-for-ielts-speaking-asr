 That'll do us for part three. Okay. All done. Thank you. So yeah, let's let's talk about the feedback part Okay, so I would probably estimate your score to be at least 5.5 in the IELTS test, right? I'm in terms of grammar if we talk about that I think you have a little bit of habit of using the continuous tense When you should use present simple tense. Oh, yeah, it's all good, but sometimes you were saying like I'm thinking I'm a student So I think I'm a student instead of the ING form or for example, sometimes I'm going to the gym It should be sometimes I go to the gym when you talk about your regular habits. Yeah A little bit about prepositions when you say when you talked about your teacher you said she was passionate in this language So the preposition with passionate is about passionate about something. Mm-hmm So she's passionate about teaching you're passionate about whatever If we talk a little bit about pronunciation, I would say like the V sound, you know, we yeah, she'd be like very Very yeah village. We'll be let's yeah, so there's a little bit of V and W were kind of mixing. So yeah, it's a little bit about that and another one would be the TH part You know the think and that so pronunciation was pretty clear, but I would say the V on the T-h Yeah, yeah, those ones they could probably work on a little bit a little bit about countable and uncountable Like a few times I heard you say like so much for example so much friends I should be so many. Yeah, so many friends. Oh, I'm sorry, but yeah a little bit about that If we talk about the test. Yeah, so part two It's advisable to try to keep speaking so the maximum time is two minutes So I would say in the real IELTS test I would try and like answer each of of these questions for yeah, try for a full two minutes And yeah in part three of the IELTS test it's usually talking about general trends So I wouldn't talk about like your personal experience If like if the examiner asks you about like how can parents or what do people normally do? I would keep it like people in general usually yeah, yeah, but yeah, it was a good test over also. Thank you for taking it Hmm perfect
