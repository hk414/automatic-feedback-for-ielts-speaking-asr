 Thank you. All right, so yeah, let's start with the feedback for the test. So I think it was a good test. You're very clear at communication. You understood and answered all the questions very well, right? I would probably estimate your score to be 5.5 today. Yeah. I'll bring you through some things that we could improve on. I'll give you this after anyway, but I'll just point out a few little errors. So if we look at part one of the tests, we talked about traveling. You said like, I'm trying to travel at least once or twice a year. Was it there? That should be present simple tense, because it's talking about routine. So I try to travel. I try to travel at least once a year. Yeah. One thing with your preposition, you said, I'm busy for studying. You should probably say, I'm busy with my studies. I'm busy with work. I'm busy with a lot of things these days. One common error here as well. I usually go travel in Korea. So go and travel. They're both used as verbs here. So it's kind of like a double. So I would delete, go, and I usually travel in Korea. So I would say travel. Or you can also say go on trips. I usually go on trips in Korea. I usually travel in Korea. Right. One more thing the question was, how do you feel when you're traveling? You said, I feel exciting. So when you say, I feel, you should say, ED, I feel excited. I feel tired. I feel bored. You can say like, when you talk about traveling, it is exciting. It's boring. It's, you know, whatever. And some of your answers in part one were a little bit short. We were talking about chatting a lot in a group, try to give a little bit more reasons if you can. Also just to clarify, like chatting is not always like on the phone. So I think sometimes people are confused with that. But chatting is face to face as well. So the last question or the second last question was, do you prefer face to face or social media? So that was the only time we were talking about social media. Usually when people say, chat, it means like, talk, go to a cafe and chat with their friends. Yeah. Okay, that was part one. Part two was good. You spoke for almost a full two minutes. It was nice. Something just be careful in part two was your tense. Most of the time you were speaking in present tense. So you were saying it makes me tired. It includes, we have to ignore all of them. So yeah, we had to. It included. It made us tired. He ignored all our messages. So just be careful. You know, like when you read the question, you can see like, it's all past tense. So just try and be a little bit careful there. And at the end you said we told to our teacher, when you use the verb tell, there is no preposition here. So we told our teacher with ask tell and call contact these verbs. There is no preposition there. So like we asked him, we told him, we called him. All right. And part three, like yeah, again, you answered all the questions clearly. There was a lot of repetition with, I think most answers began with I think. I think so try and use some variety there. Like in my opinion, it's because, or I would say from my perspective, people are tired because of, so just variety is important there. One common error as well that I hear a lot. You said it depends on people, when it should be, it depends on the person. It depends on the person. So you should usually say it depends on the plus singular noun. Yeah, so it depends on the day, it depends on the season, it depends on the job. And so again, like really clear communication and really nice, just sometimes we like a little bit more, a little bit more expanded answers. I'll give you this, you can look at this as well. Yeah. So thanks for coming in. Thank you. Thank you.
