 Alright, let's start the feedback now. I'll give you some feedback. So it was a nice test. You showed a lot of good vocabulary and grammar was accurate a lot of the time. Some hesitation, but you know, that's normal with everyone. I would estimate your score to be, you know, I'd say estimate about 6.0 could drop to 5.5 with some hesitation errors. Okay, that'd be a estimation. Going through it, I started with pronunciation. Okay, so pronunciation is generally clear to understand. The one thing I would practice a little bit is the TH sound. Yeah, things, yeah, the thing. And even like at the end of the sentence, like with, yeah. Like it was very clear to understand you. There was no issue with understanding, but if you wanted to improve it a little, I would probably focus on that. Yeah, right. What do we see? Think with countable, uncountable. When you said homeworks, so homework is an uncountable noun. Never an S there. Some common uncountable nouns that I would say is like, information, advice, knowledge, equipment, homework. These are all very common examples of what people say, but yeah, that's pretty good. What else have we got? When you talked about your hometown in Baku, when you talked about the temperature, you said it feels that it's more than minus seven. Oh, sorry, you said it seems that instead of seems, probably feels is better when you talk about the temperature. Feels hot, feels cold. One expression was almost perfect. You said, I wish I went to the gym in the morning. Instead of went there, you should say, could go. So I wish I could do that. Yeah, it's kind of more unrealistic, but it's what you want to do. I wish I went is more past regret. But yeah, that's good. When you were young, I would go swimming. So I would as a substitute, you can also say, I used to, so let's try and use both of them. Instead of repeating would twice. And so that, yeah. And you use your smartphone these days to reach two places. Instead of reach two, just reach. I use my smartphone to reach places. Yeah, and your answers in part one, I have many pastimes, photography, swimming. I would say just try and explain a little bit. So I elaborate a little bit. Yeah, if you could, because some of your answers were a little bit short. I can see your English is really good before the test. We were talking, you can speak very well. But in the IELTS test, to get a good score, you have to really explain in detail. Yeah. What do we see? So one thing, you were saying in my point of view, the correct expression should be from my point of view. Yeah, so you could say, from my point of view, you could also say, from my perspective, you could also, more casual way, you could say, the way I see it, the way I see it. So it could be good to maybe make some variety between those. In part two, you use a nice expression. You said, if I'm not mistaken, that's really nice. Because in part two, you're kind of going on past memory. That's a very natural expression. If I'm not mistaken, if I remember correctly, really nice. Another good thing, in part three, I give you a difficult question. And you said, let me think about that. It's a tough question. That's really good as well. So I would always encourage students when they receive a question that's quite difficult. Use expressions like these. Yeah, it's really good. Just one last thing. When you use the term get in touch, it's more like contacting a person one time. So like two weeks ago, my friend got in touch with me with childhood friend. I think it's better to say, like, keep in touch. I can touch. Yeah. But yeah, overall, it was a good test. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you.
