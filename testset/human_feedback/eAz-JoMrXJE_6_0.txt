 Okay, yes, so let's start with the feedback part of it now. I would estimate your score to be 6.0 around 6.0 If I go through a few things with you If we talk about vocabulary first of all, let's talk about countable and uncountable words There was a few cases of that. So I think it was you said that knowledge is stuff and works So it should be just they should all be singular right knowledge stuff and work. Yep One word you used also as well was folder phone. I think that's more commonly called a flip phone So in the one that kind of like goes like that Yeah, that would be called a flip phone and you know the the current phones now they're called like foldable phones so foldable is more like the new style but in the past they would be called like flip phones Yeah, and also when we talk about vocabulary as well when you're doing the part two question, you know It says what types of people like do this job? So I would I would try to get more adjectives in there, you know teachers should be like patient They should be understanding. This should be like compassionate people as I would try and like answer that one with some more Advanced adjectives. I think would be good In terms of the grammar there's a few things. I'll just point out At the beginning I asked you about your job and you said like I had worked as a Video editor so had worked as in the past perfect tense But we only need to use this if we're Ordering things in the past if we're making an order Right, so I think it's better in that case like I used to like I used to work as a video editor, but not quite anymore In terms of the verbs to use when you talked about the internet with your first iPhone You said like I could do internet. I would say like use the internet or log on to the internet and could be better verbs to use One point as well when we talked about calling and texting you mentioned Transmit my message It's understandable. It seems a little bit awkward. I think a better phrase there would be get my point Across yeah, so when I'm texting my friends. I can get my point across Efficiently, you know, I don't have to you know worry about having chit chat So maybe you could use that Also when we talked about phones you said call to my mom so call like text ask contact These four verbs would have no preposition there so call my mom tell my mom ask my mom contact my mom, right? And when we talked about baseball you said I've loved I loved baseball from 10 years ago In that case we should use the present perfect tense. So I have So I've loved baseball for 10 years, you know, I've loved baseball since I was in middle school. Yeah In terms of part three, I would say a couple of times you were saying when I was in high school and when I had a job But part three is more talking about Generor, you know, the subject in general. So I probably wouldn't talk about your personal situation Unless the examiner specifically asks you I would probably keep it more in general, right? But yeah, it was definitely a good test. I'll give you this you can have a look at it after but thanks for coming in Thank you
