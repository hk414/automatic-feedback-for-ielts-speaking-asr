 are all the questions. So now we're going to get into the feedback. So for the test, you actually did really well. There was just like a few cases of mis maybe choosing an incorrect word. So like a health training. So it should be like a strength training, right? Strength training, yes. Yeah. Or like on my occasion, instead of maybe I think you meant in my opinion. In my opinion. Yeah, but those things, you know, they happen from time to time and it was just like, I think it was like two or three occasions. So nothing too frequent. And just a small few grammatical things like instead of the price of PT has skyrocketed, you said go skyrocketing. Yeah. But generally everything was like quite good. You were like very like fluent, very easy to understand. Your grammar was good. Your word choice was generally good. So overall, I would give you an eight in the speaking section. And oh, one thing you did really well was from time to time when you made a mistake, you pretty much instantly self corrected yourself, which is, you know, that's a really good sign. So I think if you just work on like these small few things, then you could get thank you very much. You're very welcome. Thank you for coming today. Thank you.
