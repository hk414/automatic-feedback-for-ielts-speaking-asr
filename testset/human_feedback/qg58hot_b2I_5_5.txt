 You're predicted score. I would say it's around 5.5. Maybe a 6. I would say more close to 5.5 for now. There's good points and there's things that we can improve on. The first thing I would advise you is to work a bit on your vocabulary. Like the more vocab you know, the more easy it is to express yourself. So even though it might be a simple thing to do, it really helps you a lot. So the more words you know, the less stress you will feel when you're having the test. And the more easy it is to tell me your ideas. So less pausing, less thinking time. You can just tell me what's on your mind. Just like you would if you were telling me in Korean. So that is always something that I would advise you to look at. One of the questions I think you misunderstood that might count a bit negatively towards your score. The question was when do you feel happy at work? So you talked about having a part-time job, right? Oh, university. So are you only studying or do you have part-time job? All study. Okay. Because in the previous question you said you're happy because you had a part-time job and then you can buy whatever you want. So because you said that your examiner might think that you do have a part-time job now also. So when you answer that question, the examiner might be thinking like, when are you happy at your part-time job? So in that question maybe it would be useful if you told me like, actually I stopped having my part-time job or I'm not doing it at the moment. So I'm not working now. So by telling me you're not working at the moment. Okay, the question was when do you feel happy at work? You're not working now so there's no answer to that question. So if you could have told me that to clarify it, then there would be no problem. Then grammar. Yeah. Grammar could be counting against you. Oh. So everywhere up until seven we allow grammar mistakes. Even like at eight there is still some room for a few grammar mistakes. But I think what helped you back from getting a six for example, that's why I was like 5.5 to 6 but maybe more 5.5. You don't use prepositions a lot. I tried to write down some of them for example, you would say you chat them. Not saying you chat to them or your phrasal verbs sometimes are lacking as well. For example you would also say almost people. Almost people that doesn't make complete sense. Instead you would say almost all people. Because if you say almost people that's like not a whole person. But instead you would say for the phrasal verb almost all people. It's like 90% of people or 95% of people. So it's those little things that you maybe need to start paying attention to as well. Also some mistakes like you've known someone for a very old time. Instead of saying for a very long time. Those mistakes could maybe be because of nervousness. It is stressful to take the test. So we make these, I call them salimestakes not because you're sali but because it's a mistake you don't make outside of the test. You make it because you're nervous. So it's little things like that. And you say it was difficulty talking to someone. Instead we would say it's difficult talking to someone. So those little mistakes that you need to start paying attention to. If you want to get like a 6.5 or 7. It depends on your goal score. The positives and there are some positives here. You don't pause much. Like you keep talking to me. Usually that is something that takes you from a 5 score to a 6. The fact that you could talk to me continuously. You're not pausing. You're not giving short answers. You can explain to me those are positive things. So that's a good thing that you're doing. Also your answers are pretty natural. It's like we're having an actual conversation. A lot of students get nervous and they would give answers that you wouldn't say the same thing if we were talking in Korean. A silly example I can give you. Do you like eating fish? Some students would kind of be nervous and they say fish has a lot of protein. Would you say that to your friend? No. So it was good that you gave me like normal sounding answers. Something else, your vocab, you use the term OTT. That's like native speaker thing to say. So that's another positive. I think your pattern, your way of talking is quite good. So if you can increase your vocabulary so you can express yourself better, that would be the first thing to do. Even though you should work on your grammar, focus on your vocab first. Once you've got the words to express yourself correctly, that's when you move on to the grammar. So I think usually I advise students fix the vocab first and then you can worry about the grammar. If you don't have vocabulary, what do you use the grammar on? It's like okay great you know the grammar but you can't talk to me. So instead it's better to have the vocab first and then it's easier to apply the grammar in order to improve your score. So yeah, 5.5 for now but I think if you can work on those things, I would say because you're kind of confident with using English. Because of that confidence I think it will be easier for you to get like 6.5 as you work on improving. So yeah, I think if we can work on those things you can get to your goal. Thank you.
