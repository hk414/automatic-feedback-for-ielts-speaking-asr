 Okay, we can move on to some feedback now. As you probably know, the IELTS has scored on four categories. So there's fluency and coherence, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. You did a really nice job here today. So most of this is just good news, but we can talk about each category individually, briefly. The first two, fluency and coherence, which is together in pronunciation. These are very strong. You have a natural speaking voice. No pauses other than to think of a word or consider the next direction for the answer, and the pronunciation is native-like. So there's really no improvements to be made there. Those are very good. Got a wide range of vocabulary. Really, no problem with any of these questions. You can describe it in good detail whether it was people's personality, based on their handwriting, a good vocabulary about hastening, or Brazilian jitsu as a grappling-based martial art, which is a very advanced and very specific way. So vocabulary is very good. Grammar's also good. Language of tenses, all very clear. I struggled to point out anything really at all. But I did notice a few times in part one that you might have forgot to use an article. For example, he said typing on computer and use laptop. So that could be either typing on computers to talk about it generally or typing on a computer using laptops or using a laptop. But if we're using the singular form, we want the article. This is a very, very small point. And maybe one, one, one, collocation that was not quite natural. You mentioned judgmental skills, but those would be probably just judgment skills. There's really nothing else. Apart from maybe one in part three, when you were describing Quizlet, you mentioned that it would be helpful for learning vocabulary. But vocabulary is actually a non-count noun. So you might be learning 2,000 words, but it's just vocabulary. This stuff is really small. So your language goes a very, very advanced and quite good. In terms of test approach, there's a few things to point out. Your part two answer was minute and 25 seconds, which is not bad. The advice is to be between a minute and two minutes. But we always advise people to get as close as you can to two minutes. And it's even okay to have the examiner tell you to stop. You have this window of time to show all of the vocabulary and grammar that you can use. So if it is possible, it's always good to keep going further. So that's for part two. And then for part three, your answers were good, but one thing that you don't have to do in part three is to give any summary. It's not like a paragraph that has a summary sentence at the end. You can just answer it and describe it and then finish. It's short enough that no summary is needed. And the other point in that section is that you want to try to avoid giving a personal example. So rather than saying, from my perspective, I think we should do this, part three really challenges you to think very broadly about what people in general would do, should do, or have done depending on the shape of the question. Those can be hard to answer because it's hard to talk for everybody, but it is challenging you to speak generally in that way. So this is a very strong test. And if I had to, and I do have to, estimate your score, I would say today was probably an 8.5, which is very good. It could be a 9 with very, very small improvement. So really nice job. Thanks for coming. I have one question I want to ask you. So the paper says, describe on application you usually use on your phone on a computer, but I used three. Yes. You too Google and chat GPD. But I tried my best to incorporate and make them into one form. Yeah. Is it okay? I am actually glad you asked. I wrote it down and kind of forgot to mention it. It would be good. In this question, describe an application. Would be to really focus on one application. That would be hard to do with Google. I mean, I guess Google is a program, but Google has become so big. And it does so many things that it gets hard to talk about it as a single entity. Because I guess it owns YouTube. I don't think it owns chat GPD. I think that's a Microsoft product. So yes, a very good question. And you would want to try to focus this one on one. I think you did. You mostly talked about Google. But you did talk about chat GPD, which loses the focus a little bit. Yeah. So yeah, really good question. Cool. Any other questions? That's it. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for coming in. Thanks for having me here. Yeah. And good luck.
