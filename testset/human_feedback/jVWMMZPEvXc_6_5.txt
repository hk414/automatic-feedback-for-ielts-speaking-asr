 let's start with the feedback. So yeah, we estimate your score about 6.5. Positive's like really nice pronunciation and yeah, at times you're showing good fluency, although there's some hesitation, but that's normal. I'll just run through like a few grammar and phrasing errors that we could improve on. So first one was I'm preparing for the university. So make sure when you talk about university, you don't put any article before it. I'm preparing for university or maybe like I'm preparing to start university. That can be good as well. When you're talking about your hobby, you said one of my hobbies. When you use the expression one of my, you have to use a plural afterwards. So one of my hobbies is, what else could you say? Oh, I asked you about starting your own business and you said like I wish I can. I think a better expression there would be like I hope I can in the future. Wish is more like for like past regrets, things that you can't change. So like I wish I could, you know, I wish I could have something that's not possible, but you should say I hope I can do that in the future. Just yeah, the small business questions were a little tricky. I think it's more like talking about maybe small coffee shops or small restaurants like owned by local people rather than large franchises. So I think yeah, you could talk about like local coffee shop or local restaurant. They would be suitable there. Yeah, make sure in part one you try to expand on your answers a little more, try and give some reasons. Yeah, if you can. Okay, part two, yeah, you spoke for a minute and a half, pretty good. So you talked about your bean bag. You were using the preposition in my bean bag. Should be on because you're kind of on top of it. Yeah, so on my bean bag, you can feel relaxable. I wouldn't say relaxable. I would say relaxed. Just put it at the end. You can feel relaxed there. Yeah, one other thing you said about hearing music, hearing music. So for first thing, music is uncountable. So you can't have any S there. So just music and hearing. What's the difference between hearing and listening to? I can't explain, but that was my mistake. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Yeah, so listening to is more like you're that's what you want to do and you're like doing it as a hobby. But hearing it's more like it's the sound is coming from somewhere else. Hearing music, but listening to music is more like it's your hobby. Yeah, all right. Yeah, it was good. A couple of things with comparatives, like more better, more healthier. Just make sure just better, just healthier. Yeah, one other common one was go to travel. So travel is also a verb. So you can just say I travel. So travel or go on a trip. Go on a trip. Yeah, so to relax, I travel. I go on a trip. Yeah. The other thing is part three. Remember like the questions are about people in general. So I wouldn't really say like about you know your experience there. I would say like people like to travel when they feel stressed. But yeah, overall it was a good test. So yeah, thanks for coming in. Thank you.
