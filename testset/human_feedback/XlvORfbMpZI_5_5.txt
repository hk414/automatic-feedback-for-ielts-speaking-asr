 So I'm ready to give feedback. So I'll start with the band score. I'll give you a five. In terms of part one, fixing things, you were very clear and concise with explaining how you were able to fix something and who taught you how to fix your mom and your dad. To pause a bit though during speaking in part one and just one comment throughout your whole speaking is using um. Try to less use less of the work. I guess actually trying to eliminate um would be best. It's completely eliminate right? So using um shows the listener that you're not too sure what you plan to say. However, if you pause for a bit and then understand what you would like to say, that is actually better in terms of providing a clear answer. So just note that. Part two, so part two you mentioned the cooking gadget. The word gadget is not used very often actually. Like a tool should I just um cooking product actually would be better. In terms of gadgets, those are usually more technical devices. So some type of cooking product. And your descriptive detail, so vocabulary there for part two are very good. And how you explained why it's useful and how you use it. In terms of part three though, part three, it seems you do not understand some of the questions. So starting with question two, so question two, do you think only scientists can invent new things? You said yes you agree and you don't agree. And you mentioned um, home maker. And question three, what inventions do you think should be improved? You provide a no specific example of an invention. For example phone or car or even pen. So certain example would have helped. But for question four, if you mentioned online applications, I assume you mean online application, like apps, yes, apps, so learning applications. Okay. And in terms of like giving a title, learning application would be best. Question six though at the end. So who should support inventors, governments, or private companies. So I did like your answers. You mentioned creating new laws, so those were actually good specific details. The main thing to try to avoid is using home. Okay, in your speaking. Thank you for coming and great job. Thank you.
