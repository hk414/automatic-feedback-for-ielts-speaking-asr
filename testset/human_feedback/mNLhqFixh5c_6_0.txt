 Okay, nice test. You answered every question pretty clearly. See your scores is probably gonna be around a six. Around that I would say today. That'd be estimation. Yeah. You do have a lot of vocabulary and a lot of expressions. You Express yourself clearly for the most part. One thing I would say is just be careful with overusing idioms and expressions when they're not really fitting the situation. Okay, so like if we just give a couple of examples would be like George S. P. H. S. P. he has a special place in my heart. You said that. That sounds like more of a personal thing. You know, so I wouldn't really use that for a celebrity. It's a special place in my heart or another example like he he struck gold. It sounds like just being very lucky about something. Something very good comes to you struck gold. I don't think they're really like appropriate for that situation. Yeah, and one time is it lives for it's make people feel bored today. Board today is a very like extreme one, you know, so You did use that expression a couple of times as well So I would just idioms are good expressions are good, but don't try to like force them in you know I feel like sometimes they just weren't fitting exactly and you're trying to use them Like obviously, you know using good vocabulary and expressions is important, but sometimes you can speak simply as well Yeah, speaking simply is not a problem Other times when we're from we're finishing our sentences like Therefore for these reasons In conclusion That you don't really need to do that in the IELTS speaking part. Let's try and end your answers with intonation to show that you're finished Yeah, so you know obviously when we do the writing part of the IELTS test It's very important to have structure and conclusions, but in the speaking part we don't really need to do that Um, but yeah, you spoke really well few few small grammar is let's just look at a couple of them, okay? I asked you some questions you said actually not just make sure actually I don't actually I don't but I want um A little bit about word choice right a little bit of a word choice like receive a gold medal or get a gold medal I'd probably say like one he won the gold medal she won the gold medal here, okay? and talking about your Like watching MMA it supports me to escape. I'd probably say it allows me to escape from my stress, yeah um What else have we got? He said yeah about Why do some people have a good memory and some people don't you said they're they're gene I'd say make sure have a plural there their genes And their parents inherit their genes. I would say children inherit like from their parents. Yeah, so children inherit their gene Okay, um I was we got here like I try to utilize my car. I try to utilize my car I'd probably say like if we were to change that I'd probably say I go for a drive Yeah, I go for a drive to clear my mind So I try to utilize my car to alleviate my stress. That's okay, but maybe I go for a drive to clear my mind Sounds a little bit more natural. Yeah, so we'll try and like use some of those expressions um Yeah, or more word choice like gsp. He said he's a donator. I would say like he donates to charity. He gives money to charity Um, so I'll give you this you can have a look at it properly, but yeah, it was a good test man. So thank you for coming in All right
