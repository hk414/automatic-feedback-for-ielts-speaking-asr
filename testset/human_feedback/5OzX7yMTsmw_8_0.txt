 we can do a little bit of feedback. So as you probably know, the IELTS exam is scored on four categories. One of them is fluency and coherence. One of them is pronunciation. And then there's vocabulary, electrical resource, and the range and accuracy. And the range and accuracy of grammar. We take a look at some of these categories. That was a very strong test, and you're very confident and strong speaker. So this is mostly good news. In terms of fluency and coherence, you're very fluent. And in fact, if anything, maybe too fluent is actually my pleasure. But an idea to improve a little bit would actually be to slow down just a little bit, because a part of fluency is coherence. And if the words are coming too fast, sometimes they can come out in wrong order. They could be minor mistakes. And it can be hard to see the connection between the parts. So if anything, a little too fluent. Yeah, just a little bit slower. A little bit slower. It does help your listener. And it helps you form your ideas clearly and as precisely as you'd like to. Yes. Your pronunciation is very natural. Native like. So there's really not anything to say there. There's a lot of good vocabulary throughout lots of excellent words, renowned side hustles and impass. These are all very good words from part one. And in part three, there were good answers as well. So about gender rules and adhering to things, or adhering to a standard on the contrary. Is a good phrase, generational wealth. These are all the advanced vocabulary that you want to be using in an exam like this. And then in terms of grammar, there's a great range of structures, complex subordinate clauses, relative clauses, and really only a few minor slipups here and there. And I think this kind of links back to the speed somehow. If you get going too fast, it can be hard to control sometimes. So there were small things like in part three, I think you said loads of amounts of loads of amounts of something, which is really just a doubling up, loads of and amounts of. A doubling up of something. And in part one, there was I think when you mentioned where your college was, you said it was outward of Toronto. Oh, yeah. I think I said it wrong. Maybe the wrong word was outside of Toronto. Outside of Toronto or on the outskirts of Toronto. That's what I tried to remember. I just didn't recall so I had to say something else. And there were one or two other places where you had a very minor error, maybe with a singular little girl, but you corrected it right away. Those are the types of things that would probably go away at a slightly slower speed. And so the only other point probably outside of these four categories, specifically is your answers might have been a little bit long. So if you were taking this test again, shortening a little bit to have more like a cohesive paragraph. Don't get going too fast, because if you do, sometimes you can get lost. And as you're doing that, that helps you as you slow down, you can stay on topic a little bit more. But overall, really strong, I would estimate your score today at around 8.0, which is very good. And a lot of this is not really language learning, but practicing the test. Absolutely. And then the process to become more comfortable. Yeah. Thanks for coming in. It was nice to meet you. It was actually an honor to come here. All right. I'm just not perfect. And it was actually my pleasure to just take this test again. I just wanted to test my proficiency, to see if I, whether I just improved my proficiency throughout the college, worked. And I think it paid off. Yeah, I think it did. Oh, no, I'm not perfect. And there are still some things like I need to fix, which is like a just speed slower. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That was a really good job. Nice to meet you. Yeah, it was actually a great advice. Yeah, thank you. Have a good day. Yeah, you too. Thanks.
