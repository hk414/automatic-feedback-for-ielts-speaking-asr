 So now we'll just do the feedback part. I would estimate your score at probably 5.0 today So I have a full list of some Some errors and some things we can improve on. I'll just pick out a few of them and I'll explain to you now Okay, so yeah first of all we'll we'll go through your answers in part one Everyone says in part one. They were they were clear, but some of them were very short Yeah, I was just one thing. I noticed for example, there was a question there Why do some people wear expensive watches and you said that to appeal their rich? And so that's obviously a little bit short for IELTS test. Yeah, so to appeal their rich to change that one instead of appeal I would say the better word there is flaunt Yeah flaunt is like show off. Yeah, I'm gonna give this to you anyway, so you don't need to write down So to flaunt their rich better word would be wealth Wealth is a noun form so people want to flaunt their wealth people want to show off to others Yeah, so again, so it needs to be just a little bit longer in part one try to give a reason for each answer Let's go through a few grammarers. Okay, so in your in my freshman years So singular there in my freshman year you met a strange professor He said she makes me upset So she made me yeah, she made me upset or you could use used to so she used to Like she used to make me upset regularly Okay, one more thing here watch a YouTube for YouTube. We don't need any article watch YouTube Watch Netflix You could say like watch a TV show on YouTube TV show on YouTube or yeah, I like to watch a movie on Netflix. That's fine. Yeah And this one about your talent you said I'm good at Making and good with your hands as I was a child So what we have to write there we should say I've been good at I've been good at whatever since Since I was a child. Yeah, I've been good at drawing since I was a child. I've been good at sports since I was a child All right, and I asked you about your Your family members do they have the same talent and you said no, I'm a precious person like precious means like really Important valuable There's an idiom actually people use for that people would say like I'm the black sheep of the family You know, I'm kind of different to the owners. Yeah, so possibly you could use that in that situation What do you see another few grammars? Okay, I a common one here. I'm almost people Very common error I come across so it should be most people Most people most Korean people Another one it is less tired so it is less tiring So always for it you say I NG it is boring. It is exciting. It is tiring So I am tired. I'm bored. Yeah What are the things we look at? Plurals as well Sometimes I hear a lot of singular instead of plural is it like small city So when we're talking in part three we should say small cities Small cities don't have many facilities large cities are very comfortable to live in Where's another one? Okay another common one here is every people so with every it should always be singular So every person every day every city Okay, with our pronunciation it's not too bad. It's pretty clear But there's some L and or when you say the word for example like recommend I would recommend you Just try and make it a little bit harder or yeah So we can practice that again. Yeah But yeah, it was a good test overall In part two as well the question is a city that you would recommend to live in not your hometown I probably wouldn't call Hongdae a city Call it a part of a city like you can say Seoul as the city because Seoul is not your hometown, right? So Seoul is fine and like you could also say I recommend this area That's also fine. Yeah, overall was a good test as a few things we can improve making part one little longer And like you can look at the grammar is here make it a little bit tighter, but overall was good. It's good Thank you. Thank you. All right. Have a good day. Okay
