 So yeah, let's start with the feedback now. So yeah, that was, I was a great test. I would estimate your score to be eight Up there. Yeah, yeah, really really strong test In terms of the strong points. Obviously your fluency pronunciation are great some hesitation here and there But that's normal. I think it was more out of you know thinking of ideas rather than language skills and yeah pronunciation Perfect Few small grammar errors that maybe I could just point out not a big deal not at all by any means One time when you were talking about mapo you said I'm still living in there So it should be just I'm still living there. Yeah as there is an adverb We do not use a preposition. So go there stay there, right same as like home, you know go home stay home You also referred to mapo as that Town I probably wouldn't call it a town. I would call it an area or a neighborhood Yeah, so a town is usually a place that's smaller than a city So I wouldn't refer to anywhere inside a city as a town. Mm-hmm. You know Yeah, one thing you you mentioned a nice phrase there once in a while I play video games once in a while Perfect then you mentioned that once in a week when you talk about Frequency you don't need the preposition in just once a week. Yeah once in a while once a week twice a week And you talked about young people in their teenager years So in their teenage Years yeah teenage years in their teenage years A little bit your habit I notice as well You're saying I do enjoy I do watch that that's fine, you know, that's for for emphasis. You can use it Yeah, I just find it was interesting. I don't think it should be used all the time But for emphasis or something that's Possibly a bit surprising you could you could like it? You know for example if we talk about like rainy days like a lot of people don't like rainy days But actually I do like rainy days. That would be a time to use it But yeah, I just find that was interesting Part two was nice You're using the Now and I'm stuff make sure that's an uncountable noun. So it should be that stuff Yeah, no way is there rather than those stuff And when you talked about the train you were using the word a fees For when you talk about transportation, I think you want to say the word fair train fair bus fare fee is usually like For example like if you cancel a train ticket you should pay a cancellation fee Yeah, or like a little bit of an extra like if you want to transfer money like overseas You might need to pay a fee like a 2% fee or something Okay One time you said the most important reason I probably wouldn't say most important there I would probably say the main reason the biggest reason the major reason I think those would be fine And also in part three a lot of the time you're saying You know talked about your parents or you said for me when I go abroad I probably wouldn't talk about your personal story in part three Part three is more like in general. So yeah, if you look at the questions is like do you think It's necessary. Do you think people should so keep it you know people in general not a big deal like you you know You most of your answers were fine, but just I think it was the last question you talked about like that Yeah, it was a really good test really good test. Thank you for coming in. Cheers
