 Let's go through the feedback. So overall, through the different skills, like your fluency and accuracy, that was excellent. You spoke very fluently. I didn't really notice any like, stammer or you weren't tripping up, you weren't hesitating, it was very good. Your grammatical accuracy was also very own points. There were only like one or two small mistakes. Like you said, your mom puts the flower on the table, not the flowers. But yeah, just very, very tiny, tiny mistakes like that and they were very infrequent as well. Your lexical resource. In part three, you kind of showed off like the more advanced vocabulary like hydroponics and things like that. But earlier the test in parts one and two, the words were a little bit simple, I would say. And also in parts one and two, maybe it was nerves or maybe it wasn't the perfect topic for you. But I felt that your answers were a little bit short. So for this test, it's really best to try and say as much as you can. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. So overall, I would give you a 7.5 on the IELTS speaking test. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much.
