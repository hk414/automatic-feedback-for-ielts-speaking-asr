 bit of feedback for now. So I would estimate your score to be around 5.0. A lot of good things, a lot of good things. Fluency is quite strong. You're able to speak most of the time. There was little hesitation. Fluency yet. For the level, your vocabulary was pretty appropriate. In terms of pronunciation, few things, just maybe like the F sound when I'm hearing the word perfect, perfect with one, or important. Important and perfect. The F and P a little bit. Super. Super woman, super man. I was kind of hearing like super. A few little things with pronunciation, but pretty clear overall. I think the thing that's going to bring you down a little bit is the grammar. There are quite a few errors coming through. I'm just going to pick out a few errors to look at and we can fix them up. Let's look at one. You said at the beginning, too much lazy, too much, noisy. So lazy, noisy are adjectives. With adjectives, you just have two. Too lazy, too noisy. I'm too lazy. It's too noisy out. You only say too much or too many with a noun. Too many people, too much milk in this coffee or whatever. That was one thing. There's small errors here. You said, I was work. Make sure I was working, ING, but I quit the job. Always when you use the the verb quit, you should say, my, I quit my job. He quit his job. She quit her job. I quit my job. Yeah, so we don't say the job. A little bit of thing about prepositions. Concentrate, IELTS study was the preposition with concentrate. Concentrate on. Always concentrate on. Focus on. Yeah. And just in sometimes as well, the plural, I'm not hearing the plural. You said there are many more cloud, many difference. Make sure you just try and pronounce the S when we're doing it. Yeah. And in terms of prepositions as well, you said I'm living soul, which is capital. So I'm living in soul. I'm living in soul. And also about articles. I'm living in soul, which is the capital. Yeah, which is the capital of Korea. Okay. These are little errors as well. He said, I love luck. I don't like visit. So we got to say, I don't like visiting. Yeah. So you can say, with the verb like, you can say, visit in or to visit. I don't like to visit. I don't like visiting. So these errors, kind of, we have to tidy up. tidy up. There was a part two answer was quite clear. Yeah. The last part of the question asks, why do you think this job is perfect? Why do you think it's perfect? I think a lot of your answer focused on your father's dish and how he decorates it. Instead of that, I'll probably try to keep it. Why do you think it's perfect? Try and answer this question. Well, yeah. Other things. When we ask you the question at the beginning of part two, you said there are many perfect job. Sometimes in part three, you said there are many reasons. You can say that, but you don't need to say it as well. You can just get right into the answer. As well in part three, I asked you about due teenagers listen to their parents. And in your answer, you were like, well, I, it depends on my mood. I don't listen. So let's try and keep the answers in general. If the examiner says due teenagers listen to their parents, you said, well, in general, teenagers don't. Yeah. A couple of questions in part three just weren't answered really correctly. I asked you, do you think salary is the most important thing about a job? And you mentioned salary man or company, but it's talking about is the payment the most important thing. Do you think payment is most important? I've had a job. So it's your opinion. Like what's the most important thing about a job? It salary is it the salary? Is it holidays, working hours? Environment. So this is what we wanted to there. And the last question, right, what difficulties do people face when they try to change careers? Yeah, that was our question. And face, face, isn't, we wasn't, it's not this one. It's like, what challenges do people have to overcome? Yeah, so to face something like to overcome something, what do people need to overcome? So maybe when people change the careers, they have no experience in their new career. They have to compete with people with lots of experience. Yeah. And it's maybe harder to learn at an older age. So yeah, just a couple of part three questions were just not as clear. So I'd say your score is about a five, but I definitely think you're capable of getting higher. If you tidy up the grammar a little bit, some of these are a little bit simplistic errors. But if you tidy them up, you'll definitely do better. I'm sure as well you take the camera away, you probably speak better as well. All right, well that's good. Thanks for coming in. Thank you.
