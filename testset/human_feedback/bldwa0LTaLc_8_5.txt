 feedback. So as you probably know there are four categories. There's fluency and coherence, there's pronunciation vocabulary and grammar. I think you did well in all of these categories, but we can talk about them each briefly on their own. Fluency is really no problem. Pronunciation as well. I can tell you've spent a lot of time in an English-speaking environment because it's all very natural and native-like. So that's very good. More good news. Your vocabulary and grammar are also very good. There's really no, there's not really any errors that I noticed. The only thing that is possible is to slightly increase the range. So your vocabulary is very accurate, but another part of that is how wide it is, how many idioms and really advanced words that you can use. So I think there's a few places where you could have found a more accurate and more advanced word. In part three I think was a good example. The last question when you were thinking of people working alone or working collectively, I think you might have been looking for individualistic as a word. And in the first question in part three, the field that you might have been describing is maybe the service industry, service and medical professions, but having all of those words just on, immediately in command is very good. In terms of grammar, I mean I guess you could use more unusual tenses, but your grammar is very good. And I understood everything. So I think you did a very good job. One only other bit is in part three, it's generally a good idea to not use a personal example. The questions are all structured so you can sort of talk about society and talk in general about other people, but I think it was the first question about people willing to help others where you discuss how you would do it. In the real test, it's a good idea to avoid using a personal example and just sort of talk about other people in general. But like I say, those are really good tests. I would estimate your score at 8.5 for today. Yeah, so thanks for coming in. Really good job.
