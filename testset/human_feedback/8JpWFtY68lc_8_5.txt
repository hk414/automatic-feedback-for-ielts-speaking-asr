 All right, that is everything for your IELTS speaking test, and now let's get into the feedback. All right, so you did really great during your IELTS test. Some of the things that I noted that you did really exceptionally well in were your pronunciation and your accent in particular. You sounded very like native like and you spoke very fluently. Also, I felt that you spoke very confidently. So that's great. You used the majority of comfortable and natural word choices, so your next lexical resource was really, really good. And you also used some nice expressions. So for example, you used like I would have to say and like to be honest, just some like things which might seem small, but they make your English speaking sound very natural, very confident, very comfortable, and it made your whole test flow quite well. All right, so yeah, you also used looking forward to some idiomatic expressions in there as well. So that's where you did really, really well. So on the other hand, there were some things which need a little bit of work. The primary thing I noted was articles. So you said, for example, in the childhood, instead of like in my childhood. And instead of the easiest way to when you were speaking about building relationships in your community, you said uneasiest way. I did not notice that. Yeah, it's I think this can happen quite commonly just out of habit, right? Yeah. And also, just some expressions, even though your lexical resource was very good, there were some choices which weren't the best. So you said when you're on traveling. Yeah, so just little things like that here and there. All right, but overall, you did really, really well in your test and I would give you a score of 8.5 out of 9. You're welcome.
