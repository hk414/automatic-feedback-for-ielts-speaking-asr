 is over and now we are going to get into the feedback. Okay. For the feedback, you really did an excellent job in all of the four sections that we grade on. So fluency and coherence, you spoke very fluently. I was able to follow what you were saying very, very easily. A lexical resource, you used very precise vocabulary and a great range of vocabulary. A grammatical range and accuracy. That was really good. There was a few tiny, tiny mistakes here and there. Like for example, you said going to beach instead of going to the beach. Just leaving out some articles sometimes, but it wasn't like a consistent mistake. And your pronunciation was really, really good. Just the word compilation, compilation, it can be a bit difficult because it's such a long word. There was one question I think maybe the way it was phrased was a bit confusing. What do you think are the effects of climate change in recent years? But you recovered from that very well. So I think overall I would give you an 8.5 in the test. Okay, thank you. Thank you. And thank you very much for coming today. Oh, well thank you for being here.
