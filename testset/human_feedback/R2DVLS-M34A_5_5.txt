 estimated would be about a 5.5 today. It's just talking a little bit about the test, part 1, 2 and 3. It's part 1, some of your answers were like a little bit short. You kind of stopped kind of before I was really expecting you. So you can give a little bit more detail and part 1 that would be good I think. The part 2 question, right, it's described a time you were surprised to meet a friend. So in the question, you told me it was a planned meeting. Was it? It was more of a you were surprised by the flowers and something else. So I'd say because of that, that wasn't answered actually the way the question asked. So just be careful and I know you only have one minute for note-taking but let's try and read the question very carefully. So I think in this question they want you to talk about a time you bumped into a friend. You know what I mean by bumped into? Yeah, like just randomly met them somewhere. So just be careful with that. In terms of the rest, there's just a few like recurring grammar errors that I'll point out here as well. Let's look at vocabulary first of all though. So at the beginning you said knowledge, just make sure knowledge is uncountable now. So you can teach them information and knowledge. Another word was a promise, make a promise with your friends. It's probably better to say like a plan. Yeah, I find students often confuse the words promise, plan and appointment. Make sure plan is more with friends and casual. Appointment is more official. Promise is something more maybe like serious and long term. Maybe or something you would say to your parents, you'd say like, I promise I'm going to study hard or something like that. A few things here. Let's just pick out some things here. Okay, so when I was early 20s, when you talk about your age group, make sure say in my, when I was in my early 20s, yeah, it was a little, it's a little inconvenience. So make sure inconvenience is the noun. You should say inconvenient. It's a little inconvenient. When you talk about doing new activities alone or with your friends, you said we can cheer each other. You could say cheer each other. Maybe a better word there would be motivate. We can motivate each other or even you could even say like we can push each other similar situation. My birthday, my birthday is February. Make sure with the month, you always say in my birthday is in February, in January, in March. A few things with tents as well. I can't expect, I couldn't expect that. I got very surprised. So yeah, I was with that. Friends can talk each other. Friends can talk with each other or talk to each other either one there is fine. The other one is a stress out. So stress out and stress is the same meaning. Yeah, so you could say I can release my stress, relieve my stress. These are fine. And when you talk about customers in the service industry, you said people that demand, you could use actually the word, you could say demanding. So some customers are very demanding. This would mean like like picky and hard to please. Yeah, so I would say like overall try to give like a little bit more information in part one. I make sure our part two is exactly as they ask. But most of the questions were answered pretty clearly. You did well in front of the camera. Okay, so thanks for coming in. I'll give you that and I can show you the rest of the mistakes later. Okay, all right. Thank you. Thank you. Lovely.
