 Great job. So now we're going to get into the feedback. Oh yeah. So overall you did very well. Just the main points I noted were that you were able to answer a decent length for most questions. Somewhere a little bit on the short side, but overall they were in appropriate length and you answered very well. Okay your extended response was also in appropriate length which is very good. Okay. Sometimes you had a little bit of hesitation, maybe for some like word choice or maybe it was the topic, but I did note a little bit of hesitation in some of your responses. Okay. One really positive thing is you used a couple of idioms here and there which is always great. So you said something comes to your mind which is a very idiomatic and natural expression. When describing your friend's fashion style you said oh it's a bit too much which is kind of a very modern idiom so it's really nice to see that included. And also in part three you said like, oh I guess like I suppose I guess is a lot more idiomatic and natural. So that was really nice to see you including that. In terms of your vocabulary choices you were relatively flexible. You didn't make any like inappropriate vocabulary choices I will say so that is something really really good. But in terms of grammar you did make some yeah I think maybe you noticed that yourself. Yeah just maybe nerves but that's okay. So like same as normal person you forgot the article. And also when you were describing like about your life updates and like how that probably won't change like what you write online you said like at workplace. It's like at my workplace. We're at like the workplace generally or in the workplace generally. Also when describing what your friend does you said oh she is making video instead of videos. Oh yeah. Yeah what do I see. Yeah so actually the ground medical mistakes you made they weren't like very complicated mistakes but rather very simple mistakes which are easy to fix. So yeah but they weren't that frequent so you did a really good job. Okay and yeah your pronunciation was very good. There was just one mistake that I noted which was the pandemic. Oh pandemic? Yes yes okay it's sounded more like pandemic. All right but overall I would give you a score of 7.5 on your speaking test. All right thank you. You're welcome.
