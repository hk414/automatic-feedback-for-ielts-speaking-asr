 So now we usually do some like the feedback time. Okay. Right. Really? Really? Free, feel free. Feel free. Feel free. I'm ready. You're right. Okay. Alright, let's start with the feedback time. Okay. So the feedback. So I feel like that was a very interesting test and I think, you know, people who watch can see that your English level is really high. You're really comfortable speaking English. There's barely any grammar mistakes. Pronunciation is very clear and you're quite fluent when you're speaking. There is a very big difference between part one and part three. In part one, the questions were very simple. So your answers were a little bit too short. I didn't know what to say. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like a lot of students feel like that in part one when the questions are quite simple. Like, do you like advertising? Yeah. A lot of people have never really thought about that deeply before. So I think that shows the importance of familiarizing yourself with some part one topics. But then when we got into part two and part three, you spoke incredibly, comfortably. You showed a wide range of vocabulary and good grammar structures. So I think it was much better in the second part of the test. Your score would be, it feels like there would be a different score in part one and part three. Overall, I would say about an eight. I would say about an eight, yeah, overall. I think you have the ability to score even higher if you explain yourself a little bit more in the first part, especially. The second part, you only spoke for one minute in total. It says you should speak for one to two minutes. So I would usually say to students, try to keep speaking and try to give some more details. But yeah, you're obviously very comfortable with English speakers. So yeah, thank you for your time. Oh, thanks for the good review. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Perfect.
