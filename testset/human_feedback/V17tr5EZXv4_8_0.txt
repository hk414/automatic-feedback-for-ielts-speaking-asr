 So that brings us to the end of your speaking test. Now let's get into the feedback section. All right. So you did a lot of things really well in your speaking test. So one thing that I really liked was you used a good variety of expressions and kind of more idiomatic language. So for example, like you talked about like dressing up and, um, you know, like fitting in with other people. So like that was really good. And I really liked your variety of vocabulary and also like higher level vocabulary. So you were talking about like phenomenon, stereotypes, things like that. So that really added to your overall test score. And it was a really big benefit to you. Okay. I also really liked your pronunciation in general. There was just one word, um, which I noticed, which could have been pronounced better. It was relatively, you said relatively, which is a very easy mistake to make, but I can appreciate that you're like maybe a little nervous. And it is the second part of the test, which a lot of people generally find quite difficult. So I can really empathize with that. Okay. Um, things that could be improved upon. I felt that when you got into your flow with a question, you did speak quite fluently and coherently, but sometimes you got maybe a little flustered, which caused you to hesitate and make some slips. Yeah. So, um, I think that could be improved upon with further practice. So that would help you like decrease your nerves. Okay. And as well, there were some small errors, um, throughout your responses. So when you were talking about like grandparents, you said you were trained more strict, but we should change that strict into strictly strictly, uh, things like that. You also said your friend's mother was a working woman. Woman. Yeah. Yeah. So as you could see, like just some like small things here and there, um, but I did find quite a few of them throughout the test. Okay. And yeah. But overall, it was quite good. There were some pauses though, which would kind of affect the fluency portion. Of the score, even though you did speak really well, there was just quite a bit of hesitation and with the IELTS test, we are aiming to speak as smoothly as possible. Oh, okay. Okay. So overall, I would give you a score of eight out of nine on the IELTS test. Um, I think if you just practice more and get more comfortable with this kind of test, then you could increase your score to an 8.5 or even a nine, okay? So just focus on staying calm and collected and your score will go up for sure. Thank you. You're very welcome. Have a great day. You too.
