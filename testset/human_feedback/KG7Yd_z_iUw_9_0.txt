 We're going to get into the feedback section now. Okay. So the oil speaking test is created on different aspects. So like your fluency, your use of vocabulary, your grammar, things like that. So you spoke very fluently. Thank you. Your English is very easy to understand. Thank you. It sounds almost native like so. It's really good. In terms of your lexical, your language, use, you also did that really, really well. You used a couple of idiomatic expressions, which is also really good. There were small few grammatical errors. So when talking about Singapore, you said, you were talking about chewing gum, but you said gums. Oh, right. Or like, bring in your train. So bring it into the train. Oh, okay. Yeah. And just like you said, like my mom, dad, and grandma is, just some very, very small things. But generally your grammar was very, very good. And yeah, so there was just one word which you also had a bit of trouble pronouncing, but it's a difficult word, ideology. Ideology. Ideology. Ideology. Yeah, but it's okay. It's just like one small thing, you know? Okay. Just about the part two, it was a little short. Yeah. But I can understand that you might be nervous. But just try to fill up that two minutes of speaking time more if you can. Oh, okay. But I think maybe next time it won't be that difficult because for you, it's quite easy to speak at length in English and in detail. So for your score, I would give you a nine. Nine. Yes. Wow. Good job. Thank you so much. Okay, so thank you for coming today and you did a really great job. Thank you so much.
