 Okay, so for this candidate, I'd give a score of 7.5. Strong points are fluency. There was very little hesitation and I think most of the hesitation was content related rather than searching for a word. That was very strong. A good range of vocabulary as well, so if we look at the lexical resource score, see used vocabulary flexibly and discussed a variety of topics with ease. When it comes to pronunciation, there were no instances where understanding was difficult. It was all clear to understand, but there were some instances of language one pronunciation coming through. Grammar errors are quite small. Plurals, articles, prepositions, small issues, but there's no there's no difficulty understanding what she's saying. For example, like it cold, I'm not hearing the pronunciation, it's cold. I'm still have, should be obviously I still have this. In terms of articles for next few years, should be for the next few years. I think I will live there for the next few years. People need money and stable job. People need money and a stable job. The third part said more scary. Obviously should be scarier, scarier, the comparative. Put more taxes for them. I would change that. I would use taxes of herb. They should tax them higher. Give it for poor people. Should be give it to poor people. Always give to with this preposition. So yeah, a comfortable test, but a few errors persist as she speaks the whole test. Okay. All right. Thank you.
