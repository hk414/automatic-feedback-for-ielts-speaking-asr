 Alright, so for this candidate Katie, the score would be 9.0, every category was very comfortable. You use a wide range of grammar structures, extremely fluent, with good pronunciation, as you can see. Exical resource as well, so for 9.0 we need full flexibility and precision in all topics, uses idiomatic languages naturally and accurately. And that, you know, that was true for the most part, but maybe there was a couple of instances where word choice could have been slightly different. But I would say overall her score would be 9.0 because she fulfilled all the requirements for the test. It was really well done.
