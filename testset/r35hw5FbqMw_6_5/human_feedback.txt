 Okay, so now it's feedback time. Honestly, there weren't many issues with your speaking. You were fluent most of the time. I didn't have to encourage you too much to talk. You were able to carry the conversation. Even if some of the topics maybe were a bit tricky. One or two mistakes with grammar. And like using the right form of the word, for example, instead of saying watching, you said watch. There was another one like using maybe to make their muscles. Like that phrase, I could understand what you mean, but maybe if it was to say to take care of their muscles. It would make a little bit more sense in the context that you were using. Something else. Here and there, there are some pronunciation issues. Like I think it was vocabulary. That was the word that you had a little bit of a struggle with. But otherwise, I didn't pick up too many grammar mistakes. Your vocabulary was pretty decent, I would say. So if I had to grade you, I would say 6.5. I think the only places where we could work on maybe is trying to expand your answers a little bit. Like in the test setting, one of the criteria is you have to try and keep talking. Try to give detailed answers. So maybe in some cases for what do people normally do to keep fit in Korea? With that question, maybe you could have talked a bit about the trends. Like these days, or yeah, I'd say going to the gym and bodybuilding, body profile, those sorts of things are very popular. Like if you could add that onto your answer, that would improve your fluency score. So those things would help you. Maybe if you can do those things, the few small mistakes that you made, if you can work on that, you could easily get like a seven. So no, overall very positive. Thank you. Yeah, it's one of those cases you didn't make too many mistakes for me to correct. It's just talk a little bit more. That's the best advice I could give you in this case. Okay. Thank you very much.
