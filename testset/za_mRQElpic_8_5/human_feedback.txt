 Okay, all right. So yeah, let's just talk about the feedback of the test I would estimate your score to be 8 to 8.5 there's a few very very minor grammar errors Yeah If we just go through them briefly It's mostly to do with articles like a couple of times you said like listen listen to the music So obviously there should be no the there listen to music and just a few times you're dropping the a article Like even if we have sofa even if we have a sofa If you swim in swimming pool if you swim in a swimming pool. Yeah She's got funny accent. She's got a funny accent very minor very minor mistakes, right? If we talk about part three when you talked about new neighbors you said during the move in during the move in Obviously when we say as you know during should be with a noun. Yeah, so the noun form should be like during the move Yeah, since moving would be a phrasal verb One sentence as well when we talked about knowing neighbors you said it's gonna be difficult to ask for help That could be acceptable. I think better one would be it would be yeah would be like a second conditional sentence So yeah, like you know, it would be difficult to ask for help in that situation Yeah, but definitely was really good test and your answers were really clear and well explained So thank you for your time. Thank you. Yes
