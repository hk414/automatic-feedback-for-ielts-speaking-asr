 Okay, good. It was really nice speaking with you today. And now let's get into the feedback. Okay. So you did a lot of things really well during your speaking test. So for example, I thought that for general accent and pronunciation was really great. Honestly, it was quite like native level pronunciation. So you did a great job with that. Okay. And also the vocabulary you used was always an appropriate choice. So your vocabulary choices were quite good. And also you used a few like maybe a harder or more idiomatic expressions. For example, you used the expression get along quite a bit and you used it appropriately. So that was really good. And you used like optimistic and pessimistic appropriately as well. So it was really good that you were able to include some sort of higher level expressions as well. So you did a really great job there. On the other side, sometimes I felt that you were maybe a bit hesitant and you paused quite a few times, especially during the second part. I know it can be tricky and I know you're probably very nervous. So those things will kind of fade away with further practice, all right. Also, just in terms of like grammatical accuracy, there were some instances where you used like the expression like more, but you also used ER at the end of the next word. So like more cooler, more warmer. Actually, when we use more, we should just say like either cooler or like more cool. Either or not both. But in general, your grammar was pretty good, but there were just a few like small things like that. Maybe it's just a bit like habitual, you know, so it's hard not to do that. But those are just some things that you should kind of focus on. All right. For your score, I would give you a score of 7.5 on the IELTS band. Just what could bring your score up a bit is just further practice to work on mainly the hesitation and pauses. And also, if you can include more idioms and like higher level vocabulary and structures next time, then I think that would bring your score up significantly. Okay. Thank you.
