 the test is over now and now we are going to get into the feedback. So there's four different sections that the Isles Test is judged on. It's like a fluency, pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary. And you really did extremely well in all of those. Your fluency was great, your pronunciation was excellent. And there was like a small few like grammatical things. Before I am here, so before I came back here, it would be a little bit more like natural sounding. The corporates instead of the corporations, so just using the incorrect part of speech. But there were very, very few errors, so you did a really good job. And you used a lot of idiomatic expressions correctly. So for example, in your last answer, you used gut feeling perfectly. So you did really, really well. The first section, the answers were a little bit short, but they were maybe not like the perfect questions to get right now. Yeah, because you said like you're taking a lot of days off right now. So maybe it was a bit like difficult to think about like, oh, you know. So yeah, that was like a little bit short, but that's okay. Your extended response was very good. And your part three answers were very well developed and very well structured. So I would give you a band nine score in the Isles Test. Thank you. You're very welcome. So thank you for coming today and very well done. Thank you very much.
