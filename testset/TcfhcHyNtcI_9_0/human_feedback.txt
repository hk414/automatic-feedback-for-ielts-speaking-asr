 So now let's start with the feedback. Okay, so that was an excellent test. I think that's definitely enough for 9.0, your fluency pronunciation grammar, vocabulary, all excellent, all very high level. One thing I would say in part two, spoke for just over a minute, maybe a minute and 10, minute and 15. So in the real exam, I would always say the students try to keep speaking for the full two minutes. And you don't really need to have a conclusion in this one. But you know, it's in the exam that says between one to two minutes, but I would usually say just try and keep speaking. But that was great. Yeah, and just, just wanna point out some like very positive things, like good expressions. I asked you one difficult question about how should parents handle misbehaving students? And obviously you don't have that experience, but you said if I put myself in their shoes, in their situations, that was really nice expression. You use some nice, nice phrasal verbs, nice idioms, nice expressions, all the way throughout. So it was really clear, really good tests. So thank you for your answers. Thank you. All right, thank you.
