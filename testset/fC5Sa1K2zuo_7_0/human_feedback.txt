 Okay, great. All right, so that is everything for your speaking test. Now let's get into the feedback section. So what you did really well was you were speaking very enthusiastically and you spoke at a decent length, I will say, for all of your answers. Part two, you spoke very well, like you had a good amount of content in there. For some of the part one in three questions, I felt that you could have added a little bit more detail, but of course it's always difficult when you're on the spots, right? Okay, I think that you also used a couple of idioms or expressions quite well. Like you said, it was packed with people, with regards to the Han River Park. You talked about different circumstances. You said your friends studied aesthetics, which is a bit more specific vocabulary. So that was really nice. However, on the other hand, sometimes I felt that you were hesitating, like quite a bit. Again, it's hard when you're on the spot, but one of the markets we look for in the Eil's test is hesitation, okay? There were also some kind of systemic errors, mainly with like the articles. I know articles is always really hard for everybody, right? And for example, you said your friend really likes the fashion, but it should be my friend really likes fashion because it's a general concept. And also you said a few times, like share that everything's, but we should say share everything. So noza and no S. Also, there were a couple of, I don't want to say inappropriate, but more like not like 100% correct word choices here and there, sprinkle throughout. So for example, the one that I noted was the common sense of MBTI. But when we talk about common sense, it's more like, oh, you don't put your hand in hot water. Kind of thing, right? I think what you meant was like common interest in MBTI or common knowledge of MBTI, okay? But I think overall you did quite well. I think there are some that you can work on, mainly with grammatical and lexical resources, also working on the hesitation a bit. So for those reasons, I would give you band seven on the IELTS speaking test. Thank you very much. You're very welcome.
