 Let's have a look at our evaluation here. I think if I had to give you a score personally, I would go for a 6.0. Do you want to hear the positive or the negative first? Well, negative first. Okay. In terms of negatives, I think there's a bunch of small things that are holding you back from getting like a 6.5 or a higher score. It's grammar. Ah, I know I have some problem with articles and some plurons. Yeah. Plurals, articles and just sometimes like choice of words. Ah, yeah. I know I have those kinds of, you know, drawbacks. It's something like the difference between bored and boring. Like I think there was one case where you said you felt boring. In like normal communication, obviously I know what you mean. But in the test context, I think that's something that they would mark you down on. You know, using the right form, I feel bored or the situation is boring. Like being able to distinguish between those. I think another example of that you were talking about just trying to think of the right way. You said it. You said when I was adulthood or when... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we would rather say when I'm an adult. Adalthood is like the condition or the time of your life. But you are an adult. Same for child and childhood. Another little mistake was like saying connected instead of connect. Or to show my cooking would be the correct way. It's little things like those that you can improve on. And I think if you were to improve on that and you spoke with the same confidence that you did today, I think you could get a 6.5. Like that is something you could aim for. Right there, I bring you into the positives. You spoke with a lot of confidence. Oh, is that a lot of advantage? Yeah, of course. Confidence. What I really like is not just your confidence, but also the fact that you could keep speaking. We also look for that. You're not hesitating, you're continuing to speak. You can carry a conversation like those are all positive things. The only negative thing that I could say about that, you speak a little bit too fast sometimes. Yeah, I know that. It's like you, especially in the part 2, you got a lot of information in like two minutes. So I don't know if is that your natural way of speaking? Yeah, because I speak the similar tone with Korean too. So I know that all those patients also complain about that. But I'm sorry, but you can't hear my pronunciation like this. Yeah, like I think, speaking too quickly, if that's your normal way of speaking, it's harder to fix that habit. But I would say if you're in a test, try to think of it as a test, try to slow down a little bit. I'm thinking of it not just in terms of me understanding you. Like I can understand you just fine. But if you speak very quickly, I'm always worried that a student who does that, you kind of trip over your own words. Like you speak too quickly, maybe you get confused by speaking too quickly. So I'm just worried about that. So if you're speaking too quickly, just slow down. Give yourself some time to think about what you're saying. Otherwise, another interesting one was talking about mechanical works. When you did like to explain about the washing, we could say that is manual work. Or physical work. That would be a better term to use. But I guess maybe a little bit of English there. I think so. But yeah, otherwise, I think those are the negatives on the positives. I think overall differently is six. I think a big benefit for you is your confidence because once you step out of like the IELTS world and you go into normal life, being able to communicate is also very important. And the fact that you have that confidence and that willingness to speak, it's very good for you. So yeah, try to keep that in mind as you're going forward. Any questions from your side? Is that well, actually, I don't have any other, I don't think about taking another IELTS exam. But I just curious about, is it separated, you know, normal conversation words and IELTS conversation word is different? You're not graded or judged in a normal conversation. Oh, I got it. Like in a test situation, there's always criteria, things that we look for in order to give you a grade. But in real life, the most important thing is being understood. I think in any test, it's the same as when you study it for another thing and when you do the job itself. There's a lot of things that you do take from your course that you did study. But there's also other things that the studying doesn't cover. I think it's good to look at IELTS in that way. IELTS can give you a lot of skills. But just because you can do IELTS doesn't always mean you'll be perfect in real life. Like you have to approach it in that way. Think of it as giving you a lot of benefits. But after you did IELTS, the work isn't finished. Mm-hmm. Like, thank you. Thank you so much as well. Thank you so much.
