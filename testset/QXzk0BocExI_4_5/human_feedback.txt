 give you some feedback about your speaking. So to estimate your score, estimates would be about 4.5 I would say today. To go through some, I'll just go through a few errors that you made, I'll just point them out to you. Then afterwards, I will give you the paper with more, but I just wanna pick out maybe five or six different errors. Okay, at the beginning, when I asked you about your hometown, and you said Siu-An, you lived there from four years old to 20. Yeah. Just at the beginning, you used the word since. Okay, so you only used the word since with present perfect tense. So I've lived there since I was four, but you've lived there from four to 20. So just use the past simple. I lived in Siu-An from age four to 20. And one time we said as well with regarding preposition, you said in there. So when you're naming the city, you can use in. So I lived in Siu-An, that's perfect, but I lived in there is not correct, just I lived there. Because there is an adverb. So with adverb, we don't want to use any preposition. Okay, just also some of your answers in part one were a little bit short. I asked you, do you usually use your cell phone for calling or messaging? And you said everyone uses kakaotalk in Korea. So maybe you could explain kakaotalk as it's a messaging app or a messenger app, but also just try to explain why you prefer messaging. Because it's more convenient. I can send the message any time. So just try to give a reason with that. Also I asked you about, do you have any plan to buy a new cell phone? So you said four months later, I will buy an iPhone. So instead of four months later, it should be in four months, in four months when we talk about that. And also give a reason in four months, I will buy a new iPhone. My old phone is slow, it's old, the screen is cracked. Any sort of reason would help just give your answer a bit more length. One question as well about losing something or finding something. What would you do? So let's try and really listen to the question and listen to the key word. So there the key word was would. What would you do if you found something in your answer? I heard like I will. So it should be I would because it's a second conditional sentence. I would give it to the police. Okay, let's move on to the part two. So we said you spoke for like a minute and 40, wasn't too bad. But a lot of the time I was hearing the present tense, you know, it's quite hard, it's quite meaningful. Just make sure it's all past simple for the question. Yeah. And just to give a little bit of info about part three as well. In part three, I'm hearing like you said, for me, I like, I like skiing. And you said, my father does a lot of overtime work. But just when you look at the third part, it's always about people in general. So like the question is, do you think people in your country have enough leisure time? Is leisure time important to everyone? So in part three, you shouldn't relate it back to yourself. You should try to speak generally, but the, you know, people in your country. So, you know, when you do the real exam, if you start answering about your personal experience, the examiner will change it back and make sure to talk about general topics. Just a couple of things as well about our prep positions. Most of people should always be most people. I think that's quite a common mistake. So most people in my country go to hiking, go to skiing. It should be just go hiking, go skiing with ING. So I'll give this to you after, but those are just a few errors that maybe there are common and a lot of people may. But yeah, thank you for coming in. All right. Thanks again. Cheers.
