Part 1:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency, uses a good range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, and is easily understood despite some hesitation and minor grammatical errors.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate generally speaks at length without significant pauses, demonstrating a good ability to maintain the conversation. She uses a range of cohesive devices such as "but," "so," and "whenever" to link ideas, which helps maintain coherence. However, there are occasional hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., "um, I'm trying to like my major because I used to study..."), which slightly disrupt the flow. These features are typical of a Band 7 candidate who can express ideas fluently but may not always speak with complete spontaneity.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using topic-specific terms like "bilingual MC," "freelance interpreter," and "amusement park" with accuracy. She also paraphrases effectively, saying "I'm trying to like my major" instead of "I'm trying to adapt to my major." Her use of phrases like "step out of my comfort zone" and "broaden my horizon" shows good lexical flexibility and idiomatic awareness, which supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "I always get to meet various people like I always work with different clients, different audiences," which shows an effort to vary structure. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement ("I'm trying to like my major because I used to study culture anthropology, but I found out that it's not really my things") and tense inconsistency ("I always have to go to Seoul so that's not good 'cause when I'm drunk I have to get back to Yongin but that's nearly impossible"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout. She uses appropriate intonation and stress patterns, such as emphasizing "Everland" and "Seoul" to convey meaning. Her rhythm is natural, and she uses connected speech effectively (e.g., "I'm kind of stuck in the subway every morning"). There are no persistent mispronunciations that hinder comprehension, which aligns with Band 7 features.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
To reach Band 8, focus on reducing grammatical errors by reviewing subject-verb agreement and tense consistency. Practice speaking more spontaneously to minimize hesitations. To improve pronunciation, work on mastering the correct pronunciation of less common words like "anthropology" and "transfer" to enhance clarity further.

Part 2:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 - The candidate speaks at length with a generally coherent structure, demonstrating a good command of vocabulary and grammar, though with some hesitation and minor errors that prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally coherent structure, using discourse markers like "so" and "and" to link ideas. However, there are noticeable hesitations and fillers ("um," "like") that interrupt the flow, particularly when explaining her role as a translating manager. While she maintains topic relevance and provides a clear personal example, the pauses and repetition ("those group work and I always try to...") suggest a need for more spontaneous fluency to achieve a Band 8.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of topic-specific vocabulary, using terms like "translating manager," "shooting," "teamwork," and "client" appropriately. She also attempts to paraphrase ("perform their best" instead of "do well") and uses some less common phrases ("make chit-chat"). Her vocabulary is precise and relevant, allowing her to express her ideas clearly, which supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "I always try to assist models so that they can perform their best." However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement ("those should make teamwork"), incorrect prepositions ("give them water"), and awkward phrasing ("I can deliver it to the models"). While these errors do not impede understanding, they prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm that enhances her message. Her stress patterns are generally accurate, and she uses connected speech effectively. There are no significant pronunciation issues that hinder communication, which is consistent with a Band 7 score.

Part 3:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency, uses a good range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, and is easily understood throughout, though with some hesitation and minor grammatical errors that prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates a good ability to speak at length on a range of topics, maintaining a generally smooth flow with only occasional pauses for thought. For example, when discussing jobs that require teamwork, she uses cohesive devices like "because" and "so" to link ideas logically. However, there are moments of hesitation, such as when she asks the examiner to repeat the question, which slightly disrupts the natural rhythm. Her responses are relevant and well-structured, showing flexibility in organizing ideas, which aligns with Band 7 features.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a wide and appropriate range of vocabulary, including less common terms like "preparations," "audiences," and "communicate," which demonstrates a strong command of lexical items. She effectively paraphrases ideas, such as using "work as a team" instead of repeating "teamwork." Her vocabulary is precise and varied across topics, from jobs to parenting to social skills, which is characteristic of a Band 7.5 candidate.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as "I always have to ask what they want from me," which shows some grammatical variety. However, there are noticeable errors, like "I always have to ask what they want from me" (correct) but also "I think all those um all those like process of communications and those stuffs" where "process of communications" is awkward and "those stuffs" is grammatically incorrect. These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and consistent throughout, with good use of intonation and stress that enhances meaning. For example, her stress on "teamwork" and "happy" helps emphasize key ideas. Her rhythm is natural, and she uses connected speech effectively, such as in "I work with buyers and also I perform in front of the audiences." There are no persistent mispronunciations that hinder understanding, which is typical of a Band 7 candidate.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
To reach Band 8, the candidate should focus on reducing hesitation by preparing more concise responses and minimizing fillers like "um." Practicing complex sentence structures with varied conjunctions (e.g., "not only... but also") will improve grammatical range. Additionally, reviewing plural forms and prepositional phrases (e.g., "process of communication" instead of "process of communications") will enhance grammatical accuracy.
