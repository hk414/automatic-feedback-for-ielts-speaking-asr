Part 1:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency, uses a good range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, and is easily understood despite some hesitation and minor grammatical errors.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, managing to stay on topic throughout the conversation. She uses a range of cohesive devices such as "but," "so," and "and," which helps link her ideas logically. However, there are noticeable hesitations, particularly when she pauses to think of words ("um," "like") and when she rephrases her thoughts ("I'm trying to like my major because..."). While these pauses do not disrupt the overall coherence, they prevent her from achieving the effortless fluency seen in Band 8 or 9. To improve, she could work on reducing filler words and practicing more spontaneous speaking to build confidence.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using precise and topic-specific terms such as "bilingual MC," "freelance interpreter," "subway," and "amusement park." She also shows flexibility by paraphrasing ideas, for example, saying "I'm trying to like my major" instead of "I'm not sure about it." Her word choice is generally accurate and appropriate for the context. However, there are a few instances where she uses simpler language than her overall ability suggests, such as saying "I always have to go to Seoul" instead of "I always have to travel to Seoul." To reach Band 8, she could incorporate more sophisticated vocabulary and idiomatic expressions naturally.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, including conditional clauses ("if I lend a car, then I would have to pay...") and relative clauses ("the only thing that we have in our city is Everland"). This shows an awareness of grammatical variety. However, there are frequent grammatical errors, such as "I'm trying to like my major because I used to study culture anthropology" (should be "I used to study cultural anthropology") and "I always have to go to Seoul so that's not good 'cause when I'm drunk I have to get back to Yongin" (awkward phrasing and missing articles). These errors are mostly minor and do not impede understanding, but they prevent her from achieving a higher score. To improve, she should focus on mastering subject-verb agreement and article usage.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout the recording. Her intonation is generally natural, with appropriate rises and falls for questions and statements. She uses connected speech effectively, such as linking "I'm trying to like my major" into a single phrase. There are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension. However, her rhythm can be slightly uneven at times, especially when she hesitates or searches for words. To reach Band 8, she could work on varying her intonation more expressively and improving her rhythm to sound more like a native speaker.

Part 2:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 - The candidate speaks at length with a generally coherent and fluent delivery, demonstrating a good command of vocabulary and grammar for the task, though with some hesitation and minor errors that prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth and coherent delivery, managing to stay on topic throughout the response. She uses a range of cohesive devices effectively, such as "so," "and," and "because," to link her ideas logically. For example, she connects her role as a translator to the importance of teamwork in a photoshoot, maintaining a clear line of thought. However, there are noticeable pauses and hesitations, such as "um" and "like," which interrupt the flow and suggest she is formulating her thoughts in real-time rather than speaking fluently. This is typical of a Band 7 speaker who can maintain coherence but may not yet achieve the effortless fluency of a Band 8 or 9.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using topic-specific terms like "translating manager," "foreign models," "teamwork," and "perform well" with appropriate precision. She also shows flexibility by using phrases like "give them water" and "have chit-chat with them" to describe her supportive role. Her vocabulary is sufficient for the task and includes some less common items, such as "client" and "poses," which contribute to a Band 7.5 score. However, there is a slight lack of variety in her phrasing, with some repetition of "so" and "those," which could be improved with more sophisticated paraphrasing to reach a higher band.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, such as "I always try to assist models so that they can perform their best," which shows an attempt at grammatical variety. She also correctly uses the present continuous tense ("I am now also working") and the future tense ("I can deliver it"). However, there are several grammatical errors that affect clarity, including "those should make teamwork to perform well" (should be "those should work as a team to perform well") and "I can deliver it to the models" (awkward phrasing). These errors, while not severely hindering understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm that contributes to her overall fluency. Her stress and rhythm are generally accurate, making her speech sound natural and expressive. For example, her intonation rises appropriately when asking "May I start?" and falls naturally at the end of sentences. There are no significant mispronunciations that impede understanding, and her delivery is confident and fluent. This consistent clarity and natural rhythm are characteristic of a Band 7 speaker.

Part 3:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally smooth fluency, uses a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures appropriately, and maintains coherence throughout, though with some hesitation and minor grammatical errors that prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates good fluency overall, speaking at length without significant pauses or repetition. She maintains coherence by using discourse markers like "because," "so," and "also" to link ideas logically. For example, she explains her job as an interpreter by connecting her work with clients and audiences, showing a clear thought process. However, there is a slight hesitation when she asks for the question to be repeated, which is a minor break in fluency.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a good range of vocabulary relevant to the topics, such as "teamwork," "preparations," "audiences," and "communicate." She also demonstrates flexibility by paraphrasing, as seen when she says "I always have to ask what they want from me" instead of simply repeating "communicate." Her word choice is generally precise and appropriate, contributing to a strong lexical resource score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "Whenever I go to work, I work with buyers and also I perform in front of the audiences." However, there are some grammatical inaccuracies, like the repetition of "and" in "and also I perform," and the phrase "I always have to ask what they want from me" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. These errors are not frequent enough to hinder understanding but prevent a higher score.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. Her stress and connected speech are generally accurate, making her speech sound natural. For example, her intonation rises appropriately at the end of questions and falls at the end of statements. There are no significant pronunciation issues that affect comprehension.
