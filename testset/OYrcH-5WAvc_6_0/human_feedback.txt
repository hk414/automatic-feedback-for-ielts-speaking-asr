 Let's start with the feedback now. So I would estimate your score. I would say roughly around the 6.0. The only issues some of your answers were a little bit short. There was a little bit of repetition as well. So I would try to vary your answers a little bit if you can. Especially in part three, the examiner will try to get more details from you. So try and explain a little bit more if you can. Your pronunciation was pretty clear and you spoke at a steady pace. In terms of grammar, there's a few things that we could maybe talk about. When you said take a meditation, I could probably use the verb meditates. I meditate or I do meditation. I think it's more common. You said you lived in Mokpo. Where is that? Just southern area. Yeah. You could say it's in the southern part in the southern part of Korea. In the southern part of Korea. I think you said it was surrounded by the sea. It sounds like it's an island. So I'd probably say Mokpo is on the coast, isn't it? Yeah. That's probably a better way to say it. Mokpo is on the coast. When you talked about your friends, you said I have a meeting. Did you say for run? For running club? Yeah, I would just say like, yeah, I'm in a running club. I'm in a running club. I have a meeting. Sometimes a meeting sounds a little bit formal, like a business meeting. I'd probably say I'm in a running club. After run, you said we're going to have some beer. We want to use just present simple tents there. We usually have some beer. After we run, we usually have some beer. When we talked about our reading habits, just be a little careful with singular and plural. I heard a few times like read books. Just make sure it's read books. Yeah. What did we see? We talk about the word stressful. I heard you saying like I got lots of stressful. So in that situation, you should say I got lots of stress. I got lots of stress. Stressful is used to describe something else, like another thing. Like for example, living in a large city is stressful. commuting during rush hour is stressful. My job is stressful. So you want to say like it for example, it made me stressed. It made me stressed. Yeah, and we talk about part three. One question, I asked you what factors make a city livable? The answer wasn't very clear. You said care. I think right in this question, I think they're looking for are they talking about maybe the cost of living or the healthcare or transportation close to nature. So I think maybe try and make it a little bit clearer there because it wasn't as clear. But yeah, you're very comfortable speaking. Just try and make sure if you are taking the test to expand on your answers if you can. All right. Okay, but yeah, thank you for coming in. Thank you for coming in. Yes, thank you.
