 Hi, let's give you some feedback. So I think your overall score would be around 5.5. Yes. It's little things that's keeping you from getting a six or more. I think at this stage it's maybe a few grammar issues. Yes. Things that I wrote down here you would, for example, say music instead of music. Talking about being same with someone, I think it's more correct if we would say you're the same as. Or the sister is the same as. Sometimes you use words a little bit out of context. For example, I think you were talking about your sister and you're sharing the same hobby and you said it's very beneficial. It kind of makes sense. It can be beneficial. You can share passions and hobbies and teach each other. But it's maybe not the most common word to use in a natural way. Yes. It could be like, test nerve or something. But I think in normal life you would maybe just say it's fun or it's enjoyable having your sister around to share the hobby with. Certain other things like saying most difference. It's also not quite correct. With a question about, I think the one swimming question you were talking about how the salty water makes it difficult to go deeper in. That was also maybe, it didn't quite make sense. I think maybe if we had more time you could explain better what you meant without one. So I think maybe a few of those things would detract a little bit from your overall score. In part two, maybe there were a few times in part three as well where you paused a little bit too much. Yes. I think they would mark you down for fluency in that case. There is a certain degree to which we have to give you time to think of an answer as well. But maybe if you pause a bit too much it's sort of in that zone of are you thinking or are you forgetting about the right words to use. So I think in the future maybe just be careful if you're taking the test again. Something that I did like for example was you using some vocabulary like your the guy that you spoke about the famous one. He likes to do gags. It's a nice word to use. It's natural sounding. So that would be a positive. Other positives, I think you tried very hard to continue speaking to try to be fluent. So I would say that's a positive on your side. So I think if you could fix or work on the grammar mistakes and just use the right forms of the words in the right times, maybe in the right context as well, I think you could see your score increase definitely to six or more. No, it's a pleasure. Any questions from your side? I think the past is my habit when I speak in Korean as well. So yeah, I think I just improved my speaking skills. That's a difficult one because a lot of people they speak naturally in a slower tempo. They speak slower, they take a few pauses to think that's the normal way of speaking. So sometimes it's hard to tell students change how you talk because that's how you talk in your native language. So I think you have to, you don't have to change how you speak completely, but I think you kind of have to put a mask on. And be this is my test face. You know, like this is what I'll do in the test. You have to maybe try and work on those things just a little bit. Just be mindful of it. Just think a little bit about it. So that if you are maybe catching yourself taking a bit too long to answer or speaking a bit slowly just to like get back into the test zone. But yeah, otherwise I would say if that's your normal way of speaking, don't stress too much. Just try and think about it that way. Yes, thank you a couple of. Thank you very much as well. Thank you.
