 Yeah, so even we went a little bit longer than the actual IELTS test, but anyway, we're just practicing it. So I'd say your score is about, I'd say, 8.0 today. Probably beautiful. What we give you that I'd say. As you know, the IELTS test is graded on four parts, graded on your fluency vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar. So if we just look at each point separately, in terms of pronunciation, perfect, you know, you have American accent. You studied a lot in America when you were young? Some everything of, so it ends up at 10 years, but I've been looking back and forth. Looking forward to OK. So yeah, pronunciation is really good. Grammar, in terms of grammar, mistakes. I heard two mistakes, I think, in the whole test. When you mention your suit, you talked about your trousers or your slacks. So I think you said like it, or you said that. So you should say they were black. It says a plural. Parachute. Yeah, exactly. That was one small one. And one time you said most of the older people. Yeah, most of the older people. I felt it when I was saying most older people. So it should be just most older people. If you're talking about a specific group, we can say most of the, you know, most of the students in this academy. But if you're talking in general, most students. Yeah. So they were the only two real grammar errors that I heard. In terms of vocabulary, I think, one time you were looking for the word self-improvement books. Right. Probably I spoke to you were looking for the rest of it. Yeah, he used the good variety of vocabulary. Some lot of natural words, a lot of very high level. So I think that's really high as well. And fluency. Fluency was almost too fluent. There was no hesitation. So, you know, sometimes if you need to, you know, pause and think and take a break, that's fine. Yeah. So I'd say though what's bringing your score down a little bit is probably your answers weren't very concise. Yeah. The logical buildup was terrible. No, no, no, no, not at all. But it's just, you know, in the real exam, the examiner might just like cut you, cut your answer a little bit. Because some of your answers became very long and, you know, there was maybe, for example, like the last question, why do some people like buying clothes? So instead of like bringing a pack to yourself, I would just like stick to the answer. Some people like buying, gives them confidence, gives them a boost, something like that. So I would say the only thing in the test, because the test is only, you know, maximum 14 minutes. And the examiner wants to give you as many questions and ask you like plenty of different topics. So they might like cut your answer short. So I would say conciseness is something that we would want to look at. But in terms of, you know, pronunciation, grammar, and fluency is all really, really high level and really good. Thank you. Yeah. So yeah, should be happy enough. Definitely. Good man. Cheers. Thank you, sir. Thank you.
