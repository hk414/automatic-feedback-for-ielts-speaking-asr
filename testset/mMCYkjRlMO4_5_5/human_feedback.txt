 Right, let's start with the feedback part now. So I'd say your score, I would estimate it at a 5.5. Yeah. A lot of good points, your pronunciation is very clear, easy to understand. And on a lot of occasions, you're using good vocabulary and a lot of nice expressions and you're answering the questions well. Other things, sometimes the fluency is going down a bit, there's some hesitation, you know, it's kind of normal, but in part two, there was quite a bit of hesitation towards the end. And just a few grammars are popping up. I'll give you this after and we'll go through it properly, but I'll just pick out a few for you now. Few grammars and vocabulary errors, okay. He said, I will be graduated in three months. Instead of be graduated, just use the verb graduate. Yeah, it's probably better to just say like, I graduate. I graduate in three months, okay. Other ones. When we say about a subject at school, you said, my favorite subject is the English, just make sure no article there. My favorite subject is English, math, science, whatever you're having. Countable and uncountable, let's talk about that. One time you said about another people. So another is always with singular. So other people. Yeah, so you say other people, another person. Each, another one, each always goes with singular. So each person, each person is different. Other things we have stuff, stuff is also uncountable now. So always just say stuff when you're talking about that. Let's do a few vocabulary or things. You said about your hometown, Chongju is placed in the middle of Korea. You could say, you could say, you just located, like Chongju is located in the middle of Korea, or just simply Chongju is in the middle of Korea. That's fine. Place, place looks, if you put something down carefully, that's placed. Like right there, I placed the pan on the paper, if you put it carefully. When you talk about facilities in your hometown, entertainable facilities, I'd probably say entertainment facilities. There are lots of entertainment facilities. What else have we? When you talk about advertisements and you said models will advertise the products, you could say that. You could also say they endorse their products, means they give their approval to a certain product. Some advertisements are overrated. I think the word you're looking for is exaggerated. Yeah, that's fine, man. That's good. Sometimes they exaggerate the specs of the product, something like that. What else have we? Just with some questions, I'm asking you, like, do you, or do people, your answer was, I think not. So when I said that, do you questions? I think I don't. Yeah, so do you like this? I do, or I don't. Instead of, I heard a lot of times, I think, I think not, or actually not. Should be actually, I don't, or actually I do for these ones. When we talked about part two, spend money on, you said spend money on buying a desktop computer. You can just leave it as spend money on a computer. You don't really need to include buying here. And just some phrases for part two as well. You can say, for example, go over my budget, over my budget. So you said, I went over my budget for that. Another phrase we could use would be out of my price range. So this computer was out of my price range. I went over my budget. So maybe these couple of expressions, we can try and use them in your part two. Yeah, but a lot of positives. I'll give you this after we can look at it. Okay, thanks for coming in. Yeah, thank you. Cheers.
