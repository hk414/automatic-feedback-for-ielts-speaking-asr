 So let's start with the feedback now. So I'll estimate your score to be around a seven. Yeah, a really good test. You're very good pronunciation and fluency. You speak very clearly. You answered the questions well. Let's just talk about a few parts of the test that maybe we could improve on. When you talked about vocabulary first, when you talked about the city, I think you said they were like vigorous, was it? Maybe vibrant would be a better word there. These cities are vibrant or lively. And when you've mentioned slower mode, and afterwards you mentioned pace, right? So I think it's better to say slower pace of life. Like rural areas have a slower pace of life compared to larger cities. You mentioned daycare center for older people. Do you mean like a nursing home? Is it maybe nursing home is better there? So nursing home isn't where they stay. Community center, you could also use more for activities for older people. So community centers in rural areas. Oh, nursery. Nursery sounds more for like children, very young children. Yeah, so I'd probably say like nursing home or... Nursing. Yeah, community center. Yeah, community center is more for organizing activities for older people and for everyone, basically. Yeah, as I said, pronunciation was really good. I would say just a little bit of confusion between leave and live. Right. A little bit there with the long and the short foul. So just make sure you try and get a little bit shorter of live in rural areas. Yeah. Yeah, in terms of grammar, grammar is pretty strong. Most of the way. Small things like you said, go to library. Usually we say the library. So yeah, I used to go to the library. I often go to the library. Go for really important meeting. So you should be saying go to a... If I go to a really important meeting, I wear a watch to check the time. When we talked about part two, this is a common one in part two. You talked about your family trip. And you said, we haven't really traveled together. So you use the present perfect tense, but you should use the past perfect tense. Like before that trip, we hadn't traveled together before. That was our first trip together. Yeah. And the same thing, you used past simple. I think this was okay here. You said, I didn't spend much time with her in the past. You could also say, I hadn't spent... I hadn't spent much time with her before that trip if it changed. Small things about countable and uncountable. I think he said, very little young people. So that's for the uncountable. So it should be very few young people live in rural areas. When the sun goes away, when the sun goes down, or simply when the sun sets, when we talk about hiking, I think you said, go for hiking. You can say, go plus ING, so go hiking, or go for a hike. Same way with running, go running, go for a run. But really clear test, really nicely answered questions. Thank you for coming in. Thank you. Thank you. Alright.
