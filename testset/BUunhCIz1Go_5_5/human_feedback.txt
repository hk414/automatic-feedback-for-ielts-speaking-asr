 Okay, so are you ready for the feedback on your IELTS speaking exam? Okay. Alright, so you did a lot of things really well in this exam. Okay, so the number one thing I think you did really well was that you spoke at length for any question I asked you even if it was something that was difficult or that maybe you never thought about before. Yeah. So that's a really big pro. Similarly, you were able to speak relatively smoothly even if the topic was hard or you got lost a little in the question. And your pronunciation was generally good. You didn't really mispronounce any words. Alright, and now here's some things that you can improve on. So you did speak at length but sometimes you seem to maybe get lost in the question through maybe hesitation or you were trying to correct yourself. But with practice, like increased practice, that will kind of calm down. I think for you maybe it was mainly due to nerves, right? Yeah. Yeah. And in terms of your lexical score, you used words well and accurately, but I think next time you should try to aim to include more advanced vocabulary to increase your score in this section. Alright, for fluency, I would just give you some advice to try and take it slowly so you don't get lost in the question, but generally overall it was very good. Now the biggest thing I would like to advise you on would be the grammar section. Yeah. So while I could understand you, there were some small grammatical mistakes, right? So for example, when I asked you about sending or receiving messages, you said I like to send them. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah, you used the geron for it, but it should just be the base form. I like to send. And similarly, when asking about phone calls versus text messages, you said you like to get a quickly reply. Oh yeah. So you like to get a quick reply. And just things like that, if I'm gonna late, if I'm gonna be late. Oh yeah. Yeah. Again, I think a lot of this probably comes back to nerves and keeping calm so you can maintain your coherence, flow, and grammatical accuracy, right? So overall, I would give you a score of 5.5, but if you slow down and increase your advanced vocabulary, then I think this score could be higher. Oh yeah. Thank you so much. You're very welcome.
