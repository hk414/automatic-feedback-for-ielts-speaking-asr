 Alright, let's start. Let's give you some feedback about your test. I would estimate your score to be 8.0 today. Really good test. Very fluent, answered all the questions thoroughly and well. So that's very positive. There are a few grammar things I'll just point out. One habit I think of yours was using the word wood. You say like I would get up in the morning, I would just drink coffee instead of breakfast. There are many meanings to this word. But wood can be used for past habits. So like when I was in middle school, I would hang out with my friends every day. It's kind of similar to used to in this situation. But in these ones I would say like I usually or I tend to or I normally, any of these three. But like that popped up I think in part one and part three. So I would just review that one. That's one. That's one. Other one. It depends on people. It depends on people. When you use it depends on. We want to say it depends on the plus singular. So it depends on the person. It depends on the season. It depends on the day. So that's one rule we should go with. I asked you who did you like to watch sports with? You said I don't think it depends who I watch sports with. A better word there would be matters. Matters. I don't think it matters. Or it matters who I watch the sports with. What else? What else? We got a couple of things with Pluros. When you talk in part three, taking photo. Make sure to put the ass there. Taking photos. Taking photos is important. I have traveled to a lot of places. Places. A couple of times there. One other thing with Pluros, right? New information. So information is uncountable now. So yeah, new information. You can say like piece of information. But information itself is uncountable. One other one, right? Seek for. Look for. So with Seek, SEK, we have no preposition. So seek new information. But with look, yeah, look for new information. Search for new information. So there's just a few things but it's a really good test. Very fluent answer the question as well. So thanks for coming in. Thank you.
