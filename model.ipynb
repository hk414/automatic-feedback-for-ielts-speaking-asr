      "\n",
      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate generally speaks at length with a good pace and maintains topic relevance throughout the conversation. She uses a variety of cohesive devices such as \"and also,\" \"but still,\" and \"because\" to link ideas effectively. However, there are noticeable hesitations and fillers like \"um\" and \"like\" that interrupt the flow, particularly when she is thinking of words (e.g., \"I'm like right now living in a place called...\"). While she manages to stay on topic, the pauses and repetition of phrases like \"I'm thinking that I could learn from like anybody, anything\" suggest some effort in maintaining a smooth, natural delivery, which aligns with a Band 7 performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong and varied vocabulary appropriate for the topics discussed. She uses precise terms such as \"freelancer,\" \"massive fandom,\" and \"life-giving meaning\" to express her ideas effectively. Her ability to paraphrase is evident when she describes her hometown as \"a kind of a bad town\" and later explains that \"the part when we have to study\" is boring. This flexibility and range of vocabulary, including topic-specific terms like \"idol groups\" and \"politics,\" contribute to a Band 7.5 score, showing a good command of language beyond basic expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, such as \"I think it's a really meaningful thing for me to do as a living\" and \"I could learn from like anybody, anything.\" However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including incorrect verb forms (\"I'm like right now living\"), missing articles (\"a place called Jungnang-gu\"), and incorrect prepositions (\"connected to the politics\"). While she attempts more complex constructions, the errors in basic grammar and sentence structure prevent a higher score, placing her in the Band 6.5 range.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm that reflects natural speech patterns. Her stress and word pronunciation are accurate, such as in \"freelancer\" and \"communication.\" However, there are some minor issues, like the elongated \"um\" sounds and occasional mispronunciations (e.g., \"Jungnang-gu\" may be slightly mispronounced). Despite these small issues, her overall delivery is fluent and intelligible, which supports a Band 7 score.\n",

      "\n",
      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, maintaining relevance to the prompt about noisy public transport. They use cohesive devices like \"so,\" \"and,\" and \"because\" effectively to link ideas, and their narrative structure is clear. However, there are noticeable pauses and self-corrections (e.g., \"um\" and \"like\" fillers), and a slight hesitation when describing the friend's phone call (\"my friend was making a short call with her boyfriend and her voice got louder and louder because of the crowded people like the loud noises that the people made\"). These interruptions, while not disrupting overall coherence, are characteristic of Band 7 rather than the effortless fluency of Band 8 or 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using topic-specific terms like \"public transportation,\" \"crowded,\" \"loud noises,\" and \"anxiety.\" They also employ more sophisticated phrases such as \"ethics in public transportation\" and \"made a lot of noise,\" showing flexibility and an attempt at paraphrase. The vocabulary is generally precise and appropriate for the context, contributing to a clear and expressive response. This level of lexical variety and control aligns with a Band 7.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as \"I think people should be... like need etiquettes in the public transportation\" and \"that time was when my nearest person made a lot of noise.\" However, there are noticeable grammatical inaccuracies, including the incorrect phrase \"need etiquettes\" (should be \"etiquette\") and the awkward construction \"the time when my nearest person made a lot of noise\" (should be \"closest person\"). While the candidate uses some complex sentences effectively, these errors, along with occasional tense inconsistencies, limit the score to Band 6.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout the response. They use appropriate stress and intonation, particularly in longer sentences like \"I think it depends on the time that you get on the subway.\" There are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension, and the rhythm of speech is natural. The candidate's delivery is confident and consistent, which supports a Band 7 score.\n",

      "3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using appropriate discourse markers like \"because\" and \"so\" to connect ideas. For example, she explains her reasoning for choosing parks as noise-free places by linking the outdoor setting to people's freedom to rest and children's ability to play. However, there are noticeable pauses and self-corrections, such as \"uh, I think the most noise-free place that was um like that took my mind was,\" which slightly disrupts the natural rhythm. These hesitations are typical of Band 7, where fluency is maintained but not effortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a good range of vocabulary relevant to the topic, including \"playground,\" \"parks,\" \"public transportation,\" and \"anxiety.\" She also demonstrates flexibility by paraphrasing, such as saying \"the place is very accessible in any places\" instead of simply \"easy to reach.\" Her use of \"I wish that people could be quiet in that place\" shows an attempt to express personal opinion with appropriate phrasing. This variety and precision support a Band 7.5 score.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as \"that place is very accessible in any places because that river is like in the middle of our capital city.\" However, there are grammatical inaccuracies, including \"in any places\" (should be \"in all places\") and \"that took my mind was\" (awkward phrasing). She also uses \"I'm a person who studied about communication\" instead of \"I studied\" or \"I am studying,\" showing some control but with errors that affect clarity. These issues prevent a higher score in this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. For example, her pitch rises appropriately when asking \"And do you think people should be allowed to make noise in all public areas?\" This shows awareness of discourse features. However, there are some minor mispronunciations, such as \"Han River\" (possibly intended as \"Hantan River\" or similar), and occasional unclear word boundaries, like \"I'm a bit feel frustrated.\" These do not hinder understanding but prevent a Band 8.\n",

      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate generally speaks at length without significant pauses, demonstrating a good ability to maintain the conversation. She uses a range of cohesive devices such as \"but,\" \"so,\" and \"whenever\" to link ideas, which helps maintain coherence. However, there are occasional hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., \"um, I'm trying to like my major because I used to study...\"), which slightly disrupt the flow. These features are typical of a Band 7 candidate who can express ideas fluently but may not always speak with complete spontaneity.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using topic-specific terms like \"bilingual MC,\" \"freelance interpreter,\" and \"amusement park\" with accuracy. She also paraphrases effectively, saying \"I'm trying to like my major\" instead of \"I'm trying to adapt to my major.\" Her use of phrases like \"step out of my comfort zone\" and \"broaden my horizon\" shows good lexical flexibility and idiomatic awareness, which supports a Band 7.5 score.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as \"I always get to meet various people like I always work with different clients, different audiences,\" which shows an effort to vary structure. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement (\"I'm trying to like my major because I used to study culture anthropology, but I found out that it's not really my things\") and tense inconsistency (\"I always have to go to Seoul so that's not good 'cause when I'm drunk I have to get back to Yongin but that's nearly impossible\"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout. She uses appropriate intonation and stress patterns, such as emphasizing \"Everland\" and \"Seoul\" to convey meaning. Her rhythm is natural, and she uses connected speech effectively (e.g., \"I'm kind of stuck in the subway every morning\"). There are no persistent mispronunciations that hinder comprehension, which aligns with Band 7 features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for Improvement**:\n",
      "To reach Band 8, focus on reducing grammatical errors by reviewing subject-verb agreement and tense consistency. Practice speaking more spontaneously to minimize hesitations.

      "\n",
      "1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate delivers a coherent and relevant response with a good range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, though some hesitation and grammatical inaccuracies prevent a higher score.\n",

      "   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0\n",
      "   - Lexical Resource: 7.5\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, maintaining topic relevance throughout the response. They use cohesive devices such as \"so,\" \"and,\" and \"first of all\" to structure their ideas logically. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., \"uh, expensive activity, so actually, that's uh...\") which slightly disrupt the natural rhythm. While the candidate manages to develop their points coherently, the pauses and repetition prevent a higher score in this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using topic-specific terms like \"gym session,\" \"muscle mass,\" \"supplements,\" and \"food consummation\" effectively. They also attempt to paraphrase with phrases like \"it doesn't matter whether I'm a man or a woman\" and \"it actually takes the discipline first of all.\" The vocabulary is generally precise and appropriate for the topic, showing flexibility and awareness of style, which supports a strong Lexical Resource score.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as \"it actually takes a lot of supplements and even a discipline and even a food consummation,\" though some of these are grammatically awkward. There are frequent errors in verb forms (\"it actually requires the protein powder and just like a bunch of like supplements\") and article usage (\"a proper amount of food calories\"). While the candidate shows an effort to use varied grammar, the frequency of errors affects clarity and prevents a higher score.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm. They articulate most words accurately, and their stress patterns are mostly appropriate (e.g., \"expensive activity,\" \"muscle mass\"). However, there are some mispronunciations, such as \"consummation\" instead of \"consumption,\" and occasional slurring of words (e.g., \"like a bunch of like supplements\"). Despite these minor issues, the candidate's pronunciation supports effective communication.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate demonstrates a good command of English with clear fluency and coherence, using a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures effectively, though with some noticeable errors and hesitation that prevent a higher score.\n",

      "2. **Individual Band Scores**:\n",

      "   - Pronunciation: 7.0\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using discourse markers like \"so,\" \"like,\" and \"but\" to connect ideas. For example, they use \"so, I think that's the reason\" to transition between points effectively. However, there are noticeable hesitations and repetitions, such as \"like a\" and \"like a\" at the start of multiple sentences, which slightly disrupt the natural rhythm. Despite these minor issues, the candidate maintains coherence throughout the responses, making their ideas easy to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using terms like \"discipline,\" \"generational wealth,\" \"tangible,\" and \"procrastinate\" appropriately. They also show flexibility by paraphrasing ideas, such as explaining that \"the rich doesn't come from lucky\" instead of \"the rich don't come from luck.\" This variety and precision in word choice support a Band 7.5 score, as the vocabulary is used flexibly and accurately across different topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as \"they are no longer dependent on the location or even the time,\" which shows good grammatical awareness. However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues (\"the rich doesn't come from lucky\"), incorrect prepositions (\"give themselves in the temptation\"), and awkward phrasing (\"the way they can just like a screw things up\"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and consistent, with good use of intonation and stress patterns that enhance meaning. For example, their emphasis on \"poor\" and \"rich\" effectively contrasts the two ideas. The rhythm of their speech is natural, and there are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension. This consistent and intelligible delivery supports a Band 7 score, as the candidate communicates effectively despite occasional grammatical inaccuracies.\n",
