      "\n",
      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, using discourse markers like \"so\" and \"but\" to connect ideas. For example, they say, \"I really like to hang out with my friends and also meet new people so I can connect new... new experience or new people,\" which shows an attempt to extend the response coherently. However, there are noticeable hesitations (\"um,\" \"uh\") and self-corrections (\"I mean new people\"), which slightly disrupt the natural rhythm. These features align with Band 7, where fluency is generally fluent but not effortless, with some repetition and hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using phrases like \"connect new experience,\" \"meet new people,\" and \"find some new chance,\" which shows flexibility and an attempt to paraphrase. They also use appropriate collocations such as \"really welcome them\" and \"strict schedule.\" The vocabulary is generally precise and relevant to the topic, which is characteristic of Band 7.5, where the candidate uses less common items with some style awareness, though there is occasional awkwardness in word choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex structures, such as \"I also find some new chance that I can meet new people,\" which shows an attempt at complex sentence construction. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"I mean new people\" (repetition) and \"I really welcome them so if they welcome to me\" (incorrect use of \"welcome to me\"). These errors, while not severely impacting understanding, prevent a higher score. This aligns with Band 6.5, where the candidate uses a mix of structures but with frequent errors that affect clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with appropriate stress and intonation in most parts of the response. For example, in \"I really like to hang out with my friends,\" the stress is correctly placed on \"really\" and \"friends.\" However, there are some minor mispronunciations, such as \"chance\" being pronounced as \"chance\" with a slight vowel shift, and occasional unclear word boundaries. These features are typical of Band 7, where pronunciation is generally effective and does not impede understanding, though there are some lapses in rhythm and intonation.\n",

      "3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at a generally natural pace with a clear attempt to develop a coherent response. They use basic cohesive devices like \"because\" and \"and\" to link ideas, and their topic development is relevant and sustained throughout the two-minute timeframe. However, there are noticeable hesitations and self-corrections, such as the repeated \"or\" in \"I also think so, yeah, I want to go someday or I want to know about more,\" which disrupts fluency and suggests some effort in retrieving vocabulary. This aligns with Band 6.5, where fluency is generally smooth but with occasional lapses.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a sufficient range of vocabulary for the topic, using words like \"amazing,\" \"fascinating,\" \"ancient treasures,\" and \"landscapes\" to describe Egypt. They also attempt to paraphrase by saying \"I want to know about more\" instead of \"learn more,\" showing some awareness of lexical variety. The vocabulary is appropriate and relevant, with a mix of general and topic-specific terms, which supports a Band 7 score. However, there is some repetition of \"I want to know\" and \"I want to go,\" which slightly limits the lexical range.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and compound sentences, such as \"I've seen many movies and documentaries about Egypt and I think their culture is really amazing.\" However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including the incorrect use of \"or\" in \"I also think so, yeah, I want to go someday or I want to know about more,\" which shows confusion between coordinating conjunctions. Additionally, the phrase \"I always want to know about more Egypt\" is grammatically incorrect; it should be \"I always want to know more about Egypt.\" These errors, while not severely impacting meaning, affect grammatical accuracy and limit the score to Band 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand throughout the response. They use appropriate stress and intonation, such as in \"ancient treasures\" and \"I want to go someday,\" which enhances the natural flow of speech. There are no significant mispronunciations that hinder comprehension, and the rhythm is generally consistent. This level of clarity and intelligibility supports a Band 7 score.\n",

      "   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate demonstrates a good ability to speak at length on the given topics with only occasional hesitation. For example, they use discourse markers like \"so\" and \"and then\" to link ideas, which helps maintain coherence. However, there are noticeable pauses and self-corrections, such as when they say \"I think if you use social media well, that it can improve your language skills really high,\" indicating some effort in maintaining a smooth flow. This aligns with Band 7, where fluency is generally good but not effortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate uses a range of vocabulary relevant to the topics, such as \"immerse their culture,\" \"overwhelmed,\" and \"social life,\" showing flexibility and an ability to paraphrase. They also use less common phrases like \"run your language\" to describe language practice, which demonstrates a good command of lexical items. This variety and precision place them in Band 7.5, as they can express ideas clearly with a good range of vocabulary, though some expressions are slightly awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as \"I think if you use social media well, that it can improve your language skills really high,\" which shows an effort to use conditional and complex sentences. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, like the incorrect use of \"that it can\" instead of \"then it can,\" and the phrase \"run your language\" is not standard. These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with good use of intonation and rhythm in most parts of their speech. For example, their delivery of \"I think if you use social media well\" is fluent and natural. However, there are some minor pronunciation issues, such as the mispronunciation of \"language\" as \"linguist\" in the phrase \"run your language,\" which slightly affects clarity. Overall, this places them in Band 7, as their pronunciation supports communication effectively despite a few lapses.\n",

However, there are occasional hesitations and self-corrections (e.g., \"um, I'm trying to like my major because I used to study...\"), which slightly disrupt the flow. These features are typical of a Band 7 candidate who can express ideas fluently but may not always speak with complete spontaneity.\n",

      "   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a strong vocabulary range, using topic-specific terms like \"bilingual MC,\" \"freelance interpreter,\" and \"amusement park\" with accuracy. She also paraphrases effectively, saying \"I'm trying to like my major\" instead of \"I'm trying to adapt to my major.\" Her use of phrases like \"step out of my comfort zone\" and \"broaden my horizon\" shows good lexical flexibility and idiomatic awareness, which supports a Band 7.5 score.\n",

      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as \"I always get to meet various people like I always work with different clients, different audiences,\" which shows an effort to vary structure. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement (\"I'm trying to like my major because I used to study culture anthropology, but I found out that it's not really my things\") and tense inconsistency (\"I always have to go to Seoul so that's not good 'cause when I'm drunk I have to get back to Yongin but that's nearly impossible\"). These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score.\n",

She effectively paraphrases ideas, such as using \"work as a team\" instead of repeating \"teamwork.\" Her vocabulary is precise and varied across topics, from jobs to parenting to social skills, which is characteristic of a Band 7.5 candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex structures, such as \"I always have to ask what they want from me,\" which shows some grammatical variety. However, there are noticeable errors, like \"I always have to ask what they want from me\" (correct) but also \"I think all those um all those like process of communications and those stuffs\" where \"process of communications\" is awkward and \"those stuffs\" is grammatically incorrect. These errors, while not impeding understanding, prevent a higher score in this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is clear and consistent throughout, with good use of intonation and stress that enhances meaning. For example, her stress on \"teamwork\" and \"happy\" helps emphasize key ideas. Her rhythm is natural, and she uses connected speech effectively, such as in \"I work with buyers and also I perform in front of the audiences.\" There are no persistent mispronunciations that hinder understanding, which is typical of a Band 7 candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for Improvement**:\n",
      "To reach Band 8, the candidate should focus on reducing hesitation by preparing more concise responses and minimizing fillers like \"um.\" Practicing complex sentence structures with varied conjunctions (e.g., \"not only... but also\") will improve grammatical range. Additionally, reviewing plural forms and prepositional phrases (e.g., \"process of communication\" instead of \"process of communications\") will enhance grammatical accuracy.\n",
