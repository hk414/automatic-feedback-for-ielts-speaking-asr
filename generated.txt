Part 1：

1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with generally good fluency and coherence, using a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures appropriately for the task. While there are some hesitation and minor grammatical errors, communication remains clear and effective throughout.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally smooth flow, managing to stay on topic and provide relevant answers to the examiner's questions. For example, when discussing his major, he explains his reasons for liking it and connects ideas logically by mentioning specific subjects like biology and statistics. However, there are noticeable pauses and hesitations, such as "um" and "like," particularly when searching for words (e.g., "I think... I think..."). While he uses some cohesive devices like "because" and "and," the flow is occasionally disrupted by repetition ("I'm currently students right now"). This flexibility in maintaining topic development aligns with Band 7, but the hesitations prevent a higher score.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary appropriate for the topics discussed. He uses specific terms like "nursing," "biology," "physiology," and "statistics" to describe his major, showing topic-specific knowledge. He also uses more advanced vocabulary such as "opportunities," "distinct future," and "realistic" when discussing his goals. His attempt to describe a rhino's color as "yellow or brown" shows an effort to paraphrase and use descriptive language. This variety and precision place him in Band 7.5, as he avoids repetition and uses vocabulary flexibly, though some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "color of rhino" instead of "color of rhino").

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, such as "I have opportunities to study a lot of various majors like biology and physiology, even statistics," which shows an attempt at varied grammar. However, there are frequent grammatical errors that affect accuracy. For instance, he says, "I'm currently students right now," which is a clear grammatical mistake (should be "I am currently a student"). He also uses incorrect verb forms like "I have a... this thing future" and "I really love to study my major and I have a... this thing future." While he attempts complex sentences, the errors in subject-verb agreement and article usage are noticeable and impact clarity, placing him in Band 6.5.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with a natural rhythm and intonation that supports his message. His stress patterns are mostly accurate, such as in "nursing" and "statistics," and he maintains a steady pace throughout. There are no significant pronunciation issues that hinder comprehension. However, some words are slightly mispronounced, like "opportunities" (sounds more like "oppor tunes") and "comfortable" (sounds like "com for table"), which are minor slips that do not affect meaning. His overall intelligibility is strong, aligning with Band 7.0.


Part 2:
1. **Overall Band Score**: 7.0 – The candidate speaks at length with a generally coherent structure, demonstrating a good range of vocabulary and grammatical control, though with some hesitation and minor errors that prevent a higher score.

2. **Individual Band Scores**:
   - Fluency and Coherence: 7.0
   - Lexical Resource: 7.5
   - Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.5
   - Pronunciation: 7.0

3. **Feedback Paragraphs**:

   **Fluency and Coherence**: The candidate speaks at length with a generally coherent structure, using appropriate discourse markers like "and" and "so" to link ideas. The response is well-organized, describing a personal experience with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, there are noticeable hesitations and fillers ("um," "like") that interrupt the flow, particularly when introducing new ideas or searching for words. This aligns with Band 7 features of being able to maintain topic development with some flexibility but with occasional repetition or self-correction.

   **Lexical Resource**: The candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using topic-specific terms like "dormitory," "studio room," "library," and "laptop" effectively. They also attempt to use more sophisticated language such as "great impact" and "advantages," showing an awareness of lexical variety. The vocabulary is generally precise and relevant to the topic, allowing for clear communication of the experience. This level of lexical range and flexibility supports a Band 7.5 score.

   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**: The candidate attempts a mix of simple and complex sentences, such as "She moved to a new place, she moved to...," which shows an effort to vary structure. However, there are frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues ("she is my girlfriend as and as with best friends"), incorrect prepositions ("go to it is easy to go a library"), and sentence fragments. While many ideas are communicated clearly, these errors occasionally hinder clarity and reflect a Band 6.5 level of grammatical control.

   **Pronunciation**: The candidate's pronunciation is generally clear and easy to understand, with mostly accurate word stress and intonation. They maintain a natural rhythm in most parts of the response, and their speech is not overly monotone. However, there are some mispronunciations, such as "dormitory" being pronounced as "dormitory" with a slight vowel shift, and occasional unclear consonant clusters. These minor issues do not significantly affect intelligibility, which is consistent with a Band 7 pronunciation score.
